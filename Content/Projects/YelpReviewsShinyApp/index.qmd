Welcome to the Yelp Review Dashboard â€“ an interactive Shiny application designed to help you explore and analyze Yelp business reviews and spatial patterns. This dashboard allows you to:

Visualize Spatial Patterns: Navigate an interactive map that displays Yelp business locations filtered by city and star ratings. Markers reveal essential business information, while clusters provide an aggregated view that you can zoom in on.
Explore Data Visualizations: Switch between multiple interactive plots to examine relationships between credit card acceptance, open hours, and star ratings. Use dynamic filters to refine your view and uncover hidden trends.
Engage in Spatial Modeling: Dive into geostatistical analysis with variogram modeling. Adjust parameters like Partial Sill, Range, Nugget, and Kappa to see how spatial autocorrelation influences Yelp star ratings.
