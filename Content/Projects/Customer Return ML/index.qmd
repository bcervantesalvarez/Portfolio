# Project Summary

## Objective
This project aimed to predict customer return behavior using a dataset with various product and customer attributes. By employing logistic regression and Random Forest models, we sought to determine the likelihood of a customer returning a purchased item.

## Methodology
Our analysis began with loading essential libraries and datasets, followed by an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of returns across different attributes like product department, size, and customer state. Key features such as season, customer age, manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), and price range were engineered to enrich the dataset.

We initially applied logistic regression for its suitability for binary outcomes. However, to improve our model's predictive accuracy, we transitioned to a Random Forest approach. This model yielded an AUC score of 0.625, indicating moderate predictive capability and highlighting areas for potential improvement through further feature engineering or model tuning.

### Key Steps and Code Highlights

1. **Preparation and EDA:**
   - Loaded necessary R packages: `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `caret`, and `glmnet`.
   - Imported and glimpsed at the training and testing data.
   - Conducted EDA to analyze returns by product department, size, and customer state.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Developed a feature engineering function to create relevant variables such as `Season`, `CustomerAge`, `MSRP`, and `PriceRange`.
   - Cleaned the dataset by transforming data types and removing irrelevant columns.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Fitted a Random Forest model with cross-validation, optimizing for the ROC metric.
   - Predictions were made on the test dataset.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Generated a submission file containing predictions.

### Improvements and Considerations

- The logistic regression model served as an initial step, indicating the need for refinement.
- The moderate AUC score from the Random Forest model suggests exploring additional feature engineering or alternative modeling techniques could enhance predictive performance.

### Technical Documentation

- **Data Loading and Exploration:**
  - Essential libraries for data manipulation and modeling were loaded.
  - Initial exploration involved visualizing returns across different attributes to identify trends.

- **Feature Engineering Function:**
  - Transformed categorical variables and engineered new features to improve model input.
  - Simplified the dataset by excluding non-essential columns and adjusting data types.

- **Random Forest Modeling:**
  - Implemented a Random Forest model with a focus on the ROC metric for evaluation.
  - Applied cross-validation for model training to ensure robustness.

- **Prediction and Submission:**
  - Predicted probabilities of returns on the test set.
  - Prepared the submission file with ID and predicted probabilities.

### Comments and Clarifications

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Made clear the purpose of data transformations and feature engineering to prepare for modeling.
- **Model Selection and Evaluation:** Explained the choice of models and their evaluation, highlighting the transition from logistic regression to Random Forest for improved accuracy.
- **Submission Process:** Detailed the steps for preparing the final submission, ensuring clarity on the expected output format.

## Data Exploration

Below are five publication‐ready plots that leverage the enriched **train** dataset (which now contains the *Region* and *Population* columns). Each plot uses a unique style, with tailored titles, subtitles, and axis labels.

  ggplot(aes(x = fct_infreq(ProductDepartment))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#1B9E77") +
  labs(
    title = "Returned Orders by Department",
    subtitle = "Frequency of Returns Across Product Departments",
    x = "Product Department",
    y = "Number of Returns"

# Executive Summary

Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key insights:

1. **EDA and Data Enrichment:**
   - **Data Distribution:**  
     Summary statistics and visualizations indicate varied purchase prices and categorical trends (e.g., returns by product department). 
   - **State Enrichment:**  
     By joining state-to-region mappings and population data, we gain extra context on customer state information. For instance, we can now better understand if returns cluster in more populous states or particular regions.
   
2. **Model Performance:**
   - **Baseline Models (Without Feature Engineering):**  
     The initial models achieved moderate performance (e.g., Random Forest AUC ~0.625).
   - **Enhanced Models (With Feature Engineering):**  
     Incorporating additional features—such as `DiscountAmount`, `OrderDayOfWeek`, and `CustomerAgeGroup`—led to improved metrics, including higher AUC and balanced accuracy.
   
3. **Business Implications:**
   - **Improved Targeting:**  
     Enhanced predictive performance supports more accurate identification of customers likely to return products.
   - **Operational Efficiency:**  
     Better predictions allow for targeted interventions that could reduce unnecessary returns management costs.
   - **Data-Driven Decisions:**  
     The integration of state-level demographic context alongside engineered features provides actionable insights for strategic planning.

In conclusion, integrating rigorous EDA, enriched state-level context, and an updated machine learning strategy significantly enhances our capability to predict customer returns and drive operational improvements.
