### Who am I?

I am a next generation Data Scientist who is eager to learn and apply my knowledge to real-world problems. I have completed relevant coursework and gained proficiency in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL. Additionally, I have experience working with data visualization tools and statistical analysis techniques. I am committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field of data science. I am excited to contribute my skills and learn from experienced professionals in the industry.


### Where do I come from?

I was born in Pasco, Washington, a small city in the southeastern part of the state. Pasco is part of the Tri-Cities area, along with Richland and Kennewick, and is known for its agricultural industry, particularly the cultivation of potatoes, apples, and wine grapes. I enjoyed the rural atmosphere of Pasco, with its open fields, orchards, and vineyards.

Before finishing 1st grade, I moved to Salem, Oregon, a mid-sized city in the heart of the Willamette Valley. Salem is known for its farms and vineyards that produce some of the best wine and food in the state. Growing up in Salem, I was immersed in the outdoors and enjoyed activities such as hiking, camping, and running. Salem also has a rich history, with landmarks like the Oregon State Capitol and Willamette University, which is the oldest university in the west. However, as I got older, I also became aware of some of the social and economic challenges faced by many families in the area, such as poverty, limited job opportunities, and inadequate access to healthcare. My family and I suffered poverty and food instability before I graduated high school. Despite these challenges, I feel a strong connection to Salem and its people, and I am grateful for the experiences and values that I gained from growing up in this community.
