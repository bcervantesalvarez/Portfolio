I demonstrate the ability to provide visualizations and statistical inferences when given a cleaned up data set. Here is the data set source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance\n\nHere are a few questions I formulated before diving into the data set: *What single component causes the most increase in insurance costs? What variables play a role in increasing or decreasing insurance costs? What would be the ideal individual to minimize the cost of medical insurance?*\n\nI look into **smokers** as being a variable of interest. Additionally, I dive into the difference of between male and female insurance costs for both smokers and nonsmokers.\n\n**If you wish to skip towards the results portion, feel free to scroll down and have a quick read! Interesting results were found.**\n\n### Set Up and Importing the Data\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n#read in the csv file\ndf = pd.read_csv('insurance.csv')\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   age     sex     bmi  children smoker     region      charges\n0   19  female  27.900         0    yes  southwest  16884.92400\n1   18    male  33.770         1     no  southeast   1725.55230\n2   28    male  33.000         3     no  southeast   4449.46200\n3   33    male  22.705         0     no  northwest  21984.47061\n4   32    male  28.880         0     no  northwest   3866.85520\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Analyzing Smoker Insurance Costs\n\nWe want to know what influences the cost of insurance. What causes an individual to pay more for their insurance? We can infer that being a smoker will drastically increase their out of pocket medical insurance expenses.\n\nI take a look into how many smokers we have in this data set. Then, I take a quick look into the smokers' distribution of charges and show a boxplot to visualize the insurance cost quartiles. Next, I dive into using some statistics such as finding the min, max, mean, median, etc. I follow up by seperating male and female smokers and seeing if there's a drastic change in their expenses.\n\n### Histogram Plot of Smokers vs Nonsmokers\n\n-   Smoker Count: 274\n-   Nonsmoker Count: 1064\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n#while a histogram is not necessary, it can really show in the visual count of smokers vs nonsmokers\nplt.figure(figsize = (8, 6))\nsns.histplot(df.smoker)\nplt.title('Smoker vs Nonsmoker Count')\nplt.savefig('smoker_vs_nonsmoker_count.png')\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n\n#num_smokers = df.smoker.value_counts()['yes']\n#num_nonsmokers = df.smoker.value_counts()['no']\n#print(\"Exact number of smokers: {num_smokers}\".format(num_smokers = num_smokers))\n#print(\"Exact number of nonsmokers: {num_nonsmokers}\".format(num_nonsmokers = num_nonsmokers))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=727 height=568}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Boxplot and Histogram Distribution of Insurance Costs for Smokers\n\nThe interquartile range is \\$20,125.33. Very high spread from the first and third interquartiles.\n\nNow, notice that we have a bimodal distribution. This means that there is a variable in the data set that is drastically affecting the insurance cost. Since there is two \"humps\" we must identify the component that causes a further jump in insurance costs for those who smoke.\n\nWhat could cause this? - Region? - Bmi? - Sex? - Children? - Age?\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf_smokers = df[df.smoker == 'yes']\n#print(df_smokers.head())\n\nIQR = stats.iqr(df_smokers.charges, interpolation = 'midpoint')\n#print(round(IQR,2))\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(20,10))\n#boxplot\nsns.boxplot(y = df_smokers.charges, ax = ax1)\nax1.set_ylabel('Insurance cost (USD)')\nax1.set_title('Insurance Cost Boxplot for Smokers')\n\n#histogram\nsns.histplot(df_smokers.charges, bins = 40, ax = ax2)\nax2.set_xlabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\nax2.set_title('Insurance Cost Distribution for Smokers')\n\nplt.savefig('smoker_charges_boxplot_histogram.png')\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=1637 height=865}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Insurance Cost Statistics for Smokers\n\nSummary Stats: - Mean: \\$32,050.23 - Median: \\$34,456.35 - Max: \\$63,770.43 - Min: \\$12,829.46 - Standard Deviation: \\$11,520.47 - Variance: 132721153.14\n\nGiven the distribution, we can say that the mean represents the true average insurance cost for smokers.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n#find mean of insurance cost for smokers\nsmoker_mean = round(np.mean(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The average insurance cost for being a smoker: ${mean}'.format(mean = smoker_mean))\n\n#find median of insurance cost for smokers\nsmoker_median = round(np.median(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The median insurance cost for being a smoker: ${median}'.format(median = smoker_median))\n\n#find standard deviation...\nsmoker_std = round(np.std(df_smokers.charges),2)\n#print('The standard deviation is: ${std}'.format(std = smoker_std))\n\n#let's see the variance\nsmoker_var = round(np.var(df_smokers.charges),2)\n#print('The variance is: {var}'.format(var = smoker_var))\n\n#maximum cost\nsmoker_max = round(np.max(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The maximum insurance cost for being a smoker is: ${max}'.format(max = smoker_max))\n\n#minimum cost\nsmoker_min = round(np.min(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The minimum insurance cost for being a smoker is: ${min}'.format(min = smoker_min))\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Seperating Male and Female Smokers\n\nI chose to seperate male and female smokers to see if there was a noticable difference in cost. Notice in the graphs below, that we can easily identify the culprit for the bimodal distribution. The **BMI** drastically influences the insurance cost when it is greater than or equal to 30 (the obese rating starts at 30 forward). *This means that being obese AND being a smoker can sharply increase your medical insurance cost.*\n\nNote: As **Age** slowly increases, the insurance cost also slowly increases. So, there is a gradual increase in insurance cost as you age. That is common sense since as one ages, one develops more health issues as they near death.\n\n### Analyzing Male Smokers\n\nGraph One: Cost Distribution - Bimodal Distribution is again present. - Two clusters of cost are due to an underlying variable.\n\nGraph Two: Barplot of Average Cost per Child - No clear trend. - Only valuable note is that having 4 children seems to have an overall lower average insurance cost.\n\nGraph Three: Scatterplot of Cost vs BMI with Region - There is a visable linear relationship between BMI and Cost. - There are two clusters of individuals but follows the linear relationship. - At \\>=30 BMI, there is a clear signifcant increase in insurance cost for male smokers. - Note: a BMI of 30 or implies that the individual is \"obese\" (though, BMI is not necessarily a good measurement--see results). - No trends with the region.\n\nGraph Four: Scatterplot of Cost vs Age with Children - There is a linear trend, but split into two linear clusters. - As found earlier, this is most likely due to BMI differences in the indivduals. - Overtime, an individual's insurance cost will increase as expected.\n\nGraph Five: Barplot of Average Cost per Region - No valuable insights can be drawn.\n\nGraph Six: Boxplot of Male Smoker Insurance Cost - Noteworthy to see the spread of male smokers' insurance cost.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n#seperate all male smokers from the main data set\ndf_male_smoker = df_smokers[df_smokers.sex == 'male']\ndf_nonsmokers = df[df.smoker == 'no']\n#print(df_nonsmokers.head())\n#print(df_male_smoker.head())\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2,3,figsize=(40,30))\nsns.set_style('darkgrid')\nsns.set(font_scale = 3)\n\n#histogram male smoker\nsns.histplot(df_male_smoker.charges, bins = 40, ax = ax[0,0])\nax[0,0].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost Distribution')\nax[0,0].set_xlabel('Insurnance Cost (USD)')\n\n#barplot for insurance cost of male smokers per child\ndf_children = df_male_smoker.groupby('children').mean().reset_index()\n#print(df_children.head())\n\nsns.barplot(x = df_children.children, y = df_children.charges, ax = ax[0,1])\nax[0,1].set_title('Average Male Smoker Insurance Cost Per Child')\nax[0,1].set_xlabel('Number of Children')\nax[0,1].set_ylabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\n#scatterplot for insurance cost of male smokers by BMI\nsns.scatterplot(x = df_male_smoker.bmi, y = df_male_smoker.charges,\n                hue = df_male_smoker.region,\n                size = df_male_smoker.region,\n                sizes = (75, 250), ax = ax[0,2])\nax[0,2].axvline(x = 30, color = 'gray', label = 'Obese BMI')\nax[0,2].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost vs BMI')\nax[0,2].set_xlabel('BMI')\nax[0,2].set_ylabel('Insurance Costs (USD)')\nax[0,2].legend(bbox_to_anchor = (1.0, 1))\n\n#scatterplot for insurance cost of male smokers by age\nsns.scatterplot(x = df_male_smoker.age, y = df_male_smoker.charges,\n                hue = df_male_smoker.children,\n                size = df_male_smoker.children, sizes = (125,250),\n                ax = ax[1,0])\nax[1,0].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost vs Age')\nax[1,0].set_xlabel('Age')\nax[1,0].set_ylabel('Insurance Costs (USD)')\n\n#barplot for insurance cost of male smokers per region\ndf_region = df_male_smoker.groupby('region').mean().reset_index()\n#print(df_region.head())\n\nsns.barplot(x = df_region.region,  y = df_region.charges, ax = ax[1,1])\nax[1,1].set_title('Average Male Smoker Insurance Cost Per Region')\nax[1,1].set_xlabel('Region')\nax[1,1].set_ylabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\n#boxplot of male smoker boxplot\nsns.boxplot(x = df_male_smoker.charges, ax = ax[1,2])\nax[1,2].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost Boxplot')\nax[1,2].set_xlabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\nplt.savefig('male_smoker_charges_plots.png')\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.png){width=3525 height=2355}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### BMI Graph Highlighted\n\nAs mentioned above, the reason why the cost distribution had two clusters was due to the difference in BMI in each male smoker.

Male and female smokers will receive an additional charge for having a BMI equal or greater than 30. Male smokers hitch a 52% increase while female smokers endure a 49% increase. Keep in mind that this apart from their base premium increase for being smokers in the first place. To emphasize, male smokers will approximately be charged 408.57% more than their nonsmoker counterpart. Similarly, female smokers approximately pay 350.12% more than their nonsmoker counterparts. Given the data, it pushes the idea that smoking and being in an unhealthy body mass index will punish those individuals through higher health insurance charges. Note: Overtime, health insurance does get slightly more expensive as we age.\n\nThere is much more to be done with this project. I may come back to it and do some machine learning methods to predict if this sample represents the entire population or not.\n\nI included two articles: One states that BMI metric is an inaccurate method to measure human height and weight; the other confirms that tabacco usage allows insurance companies to charge those individuals a premium.\n\n\"BMI (body mass index), which is based on the height and weight of a person, is an inaccurate measure of body fat content and does not take into account muscle mass, bone density, overall body composition, and racial and sex differences\" (source: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215#:\\~:text=BMI%20(body%20mass%20index)%2C,of%20Medicine%2C%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania.)\n\n\"The practice of charging tobacco users more is called tobacco rating.
