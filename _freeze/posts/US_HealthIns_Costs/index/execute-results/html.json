I showcase my proficiency in creating compelling visualizations and conducting statistical analyses on a refined data set. Prior to delving into the data set, I formulated several key questions to guide my investigation. These inquiries included identifying the principal driver of heightened insurance costs, evaluating the variables that contribute to rising or falling medical insurance expenses, and identifying the optimal individual profile that minimizes medical insurance costs.\n\nOf particular interest in this study was the analysis of smoking habits as a variable that may have a significant impact on medical insurance expenses. Moreover, a detailed exploration of the disparities in insurance costs between male and female individuals, both smokers and non-smokers, was conducted.\n\nTo accomplish these objectives, advanced analytical tools and methodologies were utilized. Rigorous data cleaning and wrangling were carried out to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data. Subsequently, advanced statistical techniques such as linear regression and hypothesis testing were utilized to extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\nUltimately, this project provides valuable insights into the medical insurance industry and serves as a testament to the power of data analytics in unlocking actionable insights that can drive informed decision-making.\n\n**If you wish to skip towards the results portion, feel free to scroll down and have a quick read! Interesting results were found.**\n\n### Set Up and Importing the Data\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   age     sex     bmi  children smoker     region      charges\n0   19  female  27.900         0    yes  southwest  16884.92400\n1   18    male  33.770         1     no  southeast   1725.55230\n2   28    male  33.000         3     no  southeast   4449.46200\n3   33    male  22.705         0     no  northwest  21984.47061\n4   32    male  28.880         0     no  northwest   3866.85520\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Analyzing Smoker Insurance Costs\n\nWe want to know what influences the cost of insurance. What causes an individual to pay more for their insurance? We can infer that being a smoker will drastically increase their out of pocket medical insurance expenses.\n\nI take a look into how many smokers we have in this data set. Then, I take a quick look into the smokers' distribution of charges and show a boxplot to visualize the insurance cost quartiles. Next, I dive into using some statistics such as finding the min, max, mean, median, etc. I follow up by seperating male and female smokers and seeing if there's a drastic change in their expenses.\n\n### Histogram Plot of Smokers vs Nonsmokers\n\n-   Smoker Count: 274\n-   Nonsmoker Count: 1064\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=691 height=498}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Boxplot and Histogram Distribution of Insurance Costs for Smokers\n\nThe interquartile range is \\$20,125.33. Very high spread from the first and third interquartiles.\n\nNow, notice that we have a bimodal distribution. This means that there is a variable in the data set that is drastically affecting the insurance cost. Since there is two \"humps\" we must identify the component that causes a further jump in insurance costs for those who smoke.\n\nWhat could cause this? - Region? - Bmi? - Sex? - Children? - Age?\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=710 height=520}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Insurance Cost Statistics for Smokers\n\nSummary Stats: - Mean: \\$32,050.23 - Median: \\$34,456.35 - Max: \\$63,770.43 - Min: \\$12,829.46 - Standard Deviation: \\$11,520.47 - Variance: 132721153.14\n\nGiven the distribution, we can say that the mean represents the true average insurance cost for smokers.\n\n\n\n### Seperating Male and Female Smokers\n\nI chose to seperate male and female smokers to see if there was a noticable difference in cost. Notice in the graphs below, that we can easily identify the culprit for the bimodal distribution. The **BMI** drastically influences the insurance cost when it is greater than or equal to 30 (the obese rating starts at 30 forward). *This means that being obese AND being a smoker can sharply increase your medical insurance cost.*\n\nNote: As **Age** slowly increases, the insurance cost also slowly increases. So, there is a gradual increase in insurance cost as you age. That is common sense since as one ages, one develops more health issues as they near death.\n\n### Analyzing Male Smokers\n\n**Graph One**: Cost Distribution - Bimodal Distribution is again present. - Two clusters of cost are due to an underlying variable.\n\n**Graph Two**: Barplot of Average Cost per Child - No clear trend. - Only valuable note is that having 4 children seems to have an overall lower average insurance cost.\n\n**Graph Three**: Scatterplot of Cost vs BMI with Region - There is a visable linear relationship between BMI and Cost. - There are two clusters of individuals but follows the linear relationship. - At \\>=30 BMI, there is a clear signifcant increase in insurance cost for male smokers. - Note: a BMI of 30 or implies that the individual is \"obese\" (though, BMI is not necessarily a good measurement--see results). - No trends with the region.\n\n**Graph Four**: Scatterplot of Cost vs Age with Children - There is a linear trend, but split into two linear clusters. - As found earlier, this is most likely due to BMI differences in the indivduals. - Overtime, an individual's insurance cost will increase as expected.\n\n**Graph Five**: Barplot of Average Cost per Region - No valuable insights can be drawn.\n\n**Graph Six**: Boxplot of Male Smoker Insurance Cost - Noteworthy to see the spread of male smokers' insurance cost.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.png){width=915 height=533}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### BMI Graph Highlighted\n\nAs mentioned above, the reason why the cost distribution had two clusters was due to the difference in BMI in each male smoker. Male smokers with a BMI \\>= 30 will that their expense increase by approximately 47%.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```\nText(0, 0.5, 'Insurance Costs (USD)')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-7-output-2.png){width=660 height=509}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Analyzing Female Smokers\n\n**Graph One**: Cost Distribution - Bimodal Distribution is again present. - Two clusters of cost are due to an underlying variable.\n\n**Graph Two**: Barplot of Average Cost per Child - No clear trend. - Only valuable note is that having 5 children seems to have an overall lower average insurance cost.\n\n**Graph Three**: Scatterplot of Cost vs BMI with Region - There is a visable linear relationship between BMI and Cost - There are two clusters of individuals but follows the linear relationship. - At \\>=30 BMI, there is a clear signifcant increase in insurance cost for female smokers. - Note: a BMI of 30 or implies that the individual is \"obese\" (though, BMI is not necessarily a good measurement--see results). - No trends with the region.\n\n**Graph Four**: Scatterplot of Cost vs Age with Children - There is a linear trend, but split into two linear clusters. - As found earlier, this is most likely due to BMI differences in the indivduals. - Overtime, an individual's insurance cost will increase as expected.\n\n**Graph Five**: Barplot of Average Cost per Region - No valuable insights can be drawn.\n\n**Graph Six**: Boxplot of Female Smoker Insurance Cost - Noteworthy to see the spread of female smokers' insurance cost.\n\nGiven that the Insurane Cost vs BMI is essentially the same as male smokers, the stated results will apply here.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-9-output-1.png){width=916 height=534}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Average Insurance Cost Comparision of Male and Female Smokers\n\nNoteworthy mention: - Male smokers pay approximately 1.34% more than their female counterparts when their BMI less than 30. - Male smokers pay approximately 1.42% less than their female counterparts when their BMI greater than or equal to 30.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-11-output-1.png){width=691 height=495}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n```\n<function matplotlib.pyplot.clf()>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Boxplot and Histogram Distribution of Insurance Costs for Nonsmokers\n\nThe interquartile range is \\$7,378.07. Spread is minimal from the first and third interquartiles.\n\nNow, notice that we have a right-skewed distribution.\n\nWhat could cause this? - Region? - Bmi? - Sex? - Children? - Age?\n\nKeep in mind, there is a chance that we may not be able to determine the cause of those outliers.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n7378.07\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-12-output-2.png){width=684 height=494}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Analyzing the insurance cost of nonsmokers\n\nNow let's look at the nonsmokers.\n\nSummary Stats: - Mean: \\$8,434.27 - Median: \\$7,345.41 - Max: \\$39,910.61 - Min: \\$1,121.87 - Standard Deviation: \\$5,990.96 - Variance: 35891656\n\n\n\n### Analyzing Male Nonsmokers\n\n**Graph One**: Cost Distribution - Right-skewed distribution is again present. - Knowing this, we should go with the median as the most appropriate statistic instead of the mean.\n\n**Graph Two**: Barplot of Average Cost per Child - There seems to be a trend that having more children will lead to higher average insurance costs. - Given the information from the smokers, when an individual has 5 children or more, their insurance costs drops signifcantly. - However, the lowest average comes from having no children at all.\n\n**Graph Three**: Scatterplot of Cost vs BMI with Region - There is no correlation between cost and BMI of nonsmokers. - This is an interesting finding. - No trends with the region.\n\n**Graph Four**: Scatterplot of Cost vs Age with Children - Strong linear relationship between insurance cost and age. - A secondary trend is shown with the number of children. - The less children, the insurance cost is on the lower end of the linear relationship. - The more children, the insurance cost is on the higher end of the linear relationship - The outliers do not follow the trend line.\n\n**Graph Five**: Barplot of Average Cost per Region - No valuable insights can be drawn. - Some regions are simply cheaper than others.\n\n**Graph Six**: Boxplot of Male Smoker Insurance Cost - Noteworthy to see the spread of male smokers' insurance cost.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-14-output-1.png){width=915 height=533}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=14}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-15-output-1.png){width=732 height=522}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Analyzing Female Nonsmokers\n\n**Graph One**: Cost Distribution - Right-skewed distribution is again present. - Knowing this, we should go with the median as the most appropriate statistic instead of the mean.\n\n**Graph Two**: Barplot of Average Cost per Child - Similar to the male nonsmokers, there seems to be a trend that having more children will result in higher average insurance costs. - Given the information from the smokers, when an individual has 5 children or more, their insurance costs drops on average. - However, the lowest average comes from having no children at all.\n\n**Graph Three**: Scatterplot of Cost vs BMI with Region - Again, there is no correlation between cost and BMI of nonsmokers. - No trends with the region.\n\n**Graph Four**: Scatterplot of Cost vs Age with Children - Strong linear relationship between insurance cost and age. - A secondary trend is shown with the number of children. - The less children, the insurance cost is on the lower end of the linear relationship. - The more children, the insurance cost is on the higher end of the linear relationship - The outliers do not follow the trend line.\n\n**Graph Five**: Barplot of Average Cost per Region - There is a slight trend of region importance. - The northeast is more expensive on average than the southwest.\n\n**Graph Six**: Boxplot of Male Smoker Insurance Cost - Noteworthy to see the spread of male smokers' insurance cost.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=15}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-16-output-1.png){width=915 height=533}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Nonsmokers vs Smokers\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=16}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe average insurance cost for a nonsmoker male is $8087.2.\nThe average insurance cost for a nonsmoker female is $8762.3.\nThe average difference in insurance cost for nonsmoker male and female is $675.1.\n\nThe nonsmoker males are charged 4.01% less than their female counterpart.\n\nThe average insurance cost for a smoker male is $33042.01.\nThe average insurance cost for a smoker female is $30679.0.\nThe average difference in insurance cost for smoker male and female is $2363.01.\n\nThe smoker males are charged 3.71% more than their female counterpart.\n\nOn average, a male nonsmoker pays $8087.2, while a female smoker pays $33042.01.\nThe difference in their insurance charges is $24954.81.\nA male smoker will get charged approxmiately 408.57% more than a nonsmoker.\n\nOn average, a female nonsmoker pays $8762.3, while a female smoker pays $30679.0.\nThe difference in their insurance charges is $21916.7.\nA female smoker will get charged approxmiately 350.12% more than a nonsmoker.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Results\n\nIt is abundantly clear that smoking is a significant contributing factor in the escalation of health insurance premiums. Moreover, both male and female smokers who exhibit a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater are subject to an additional charge, further exacerbating their financial burden. Male smokers face an exorbitant increase of 52%, while female smokers are subject to a 49% rise in their insurance charges. It should be noted that this increase is in addition to the base premium that is already charged to smokers.\n\nTo underscore the severity of the situation, male smokers can expect to pay a staggering 408.57% more than their non-smoking counterparts. Similarly, female smokers can anticipate paying an astronomical 350.12% more than their non-smoking counterparts. The data presented unequivocally supports the notion that unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking and an unhealthy BMI, are met with punitive measures in the form of higher health insurance premiums. It is important to acknowledge that health insurance premiums do increase gradually over time, in line with the aging process.\n\nDespite the insightful results obtained from this project, there remains a multitude of avenues for further exploration. One such avenue would be to apply machine learning techniques to predict whether this sample accurately represents the entire population or not. Such an analysis could help to refine the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from the data, potentially leading to further breakthroughs in the field of health insurance.\n\n# Further Study\n\nI included two articles: One states that BMI metric is an inaccurate method to measure human height and weight; the other confirms that tabacco usage allows insurance companies to charge those individuals a premium.\n\n\"BMI (body mass index), which is based on the height and weight of a person, is an inaccurate measure of body fat content and does not take into account muscle mass, bone density, overall body composition, and racial and sex differences\"\n\n(source: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215)\n\n\"The practice of charging tobacco users more is called tobacco rating. The ACA allows for insurance companies to charge smokers up to 50% more (or premiums that are 1.5 times higher) than non-smokers through a tobacco surcharge.\"\n\n(source: https://www.healthmarkets.com/content/smoking-and-health-insurance)\n\n",
