The objective was to develop accurate rules for classifying patients into three severity levels: Mild, Moderate, and Severe. A dataset containing patient symptoms was analyzed, and a random forest model was employed for classification. The top features were explored to derive meaningful rules. The results revealed that patients with 1 to 3 symptoms, including depression, were classified as Mild, while those with at least 3 symptoms, including depression and cramps (at least 2 symptoms), were classified as Moderate. Patients with 4 symptoms, including cramps and spasms (at least 2 symptoms), were classified as Severe. The random forest model achieved promising results, as confirmed by the confusion matrix. This study provides valuable insights into predicting severity levels in patients, facilitating personalized healthcare and treatment planning.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the field of rare diseases, physicians often observe variations in the severity levels of patients; however, there is a lack of established guidelines to map individual patients directly to specific severity levels. Our client, who is developing a product for this rare disease, aims to target patients with moderate to severe conditions. To address this challenge, the client possesses a comprehensive database containing clinically relevant information about the disease, including symptom flags and a symptom count variable. Additionally, each patient in the database has been rated by a physician as mild, moderate, or severe. The client has approached [REDACTED] with the objective of extracting the mental heuristics employed by physicians when assigning severity labels to patients. The task at hand involves deriving simple rules (1-3 per severity level) from the database that can effectively classify patients. For instance, a set of rules might involve identifying patients as severe if they exhibit fatigue or have exactly two symptoms. By extracting these rules, our aim is to provide the client with a clearer understanding of the factors influencing severity levels in order to enhance their product development and enable more personalized patient care.\n\n\n## Methodology\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn import tree\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.metrics import (\n    confusion_matrix,\n    roc_auc_score,\n    recall_score,\n    precision_score,\n    cohen_kappa_score\n)\n# Load the dataset\nds = pd.read_csv(\"severityLevels.csv\")  \nds.head(10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Patient</th>\n      <th>Final Category</th>\n      <th>Fatigue</th>\n      <th>Weakness</th>\n      <th>Depression</th>\n      <th>Anxiety</th>\n      <th>Dry Skin</th>\n      <th>Spasms</th>\n      <th>Tingling</th>\n      <th>Headaches</th>\n      <th>Cramps</th>\n      <th>Number of Symptoms</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Mild</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>Mild</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>Mild</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>Mild</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>Mild</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>Mild</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>Mild</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>Mild</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>8</th>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>Mild</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>9</th>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>Mild</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Feature Engineering\n\nThe code performs some data preprocessing and feature selection to prepare the data for a Random Forest model. Let's go through each step:\n\n1. Drop the ID column: The code removes a column named \"Patient\" from the dataset. This column likely contains unique identifiers for each patient, and since it's not relevant for our analysis, we can safely remove it.\n\n2. Create dummy columns for \"Number of Symptoms\": The code converts a column called \"Number of Symptoms\" into multiple binary columns, known as dummy variables. Each dummy variable represents a unique value in the original column. This transformation helps us to use categorical data in our machine learning model.\n\n3. Concatenate the dummy columns with the original dataframe: The code combines the newly created dummy columns with the original dataset. This ensures that we retain all the existing information while incorporating the transformed categorical data.\n\n4. Drop the original \"Number of Symptoms\" column: Since we have created the dummy columns, we no longer need the original \"Number of Symptoms\" column. Therefore, the code removes this column from the dataset.\n\n5. Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y): The code splits the dataset into two parts. The features, represented by the variable X, contain all the columns except the \"Final Category\" column, which is the target variable we want to predict. The target variable, represented by the variable y, contains only the \"Final Category\" column. This is the severity cases of 'Mild', 'Moderate' and 'Severe'\n\n6. Perform feature selection using Random Forest: The code utilizes a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest to identify the most important features for each category in the target variable. It trains a separate Random Forest model for each category and determines the top three features that contribute the most to predicting that category.\n\n7. Store the top features for each category: The code stores the top three features for each category in a dictionary called \"top_features.\" Each category is represented by a label, and the corresponding top features are stored as a list.\n\n8. Print the top 3 features for each label: The code then prints the top three features for each category in the target variable. This information helps us understand which features are most influential in determining the predicted category.\n\nOverall, this code prepares the data by transforming categorical data into a suitable format and identifies the top features that contribute to predicting different categories. This sets the stage for further analysis and building the final machine learning model based on these selected features.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Drop the ID

determining the severity of a patient's condition. In this case, the severity levels are categorized as \"Mild,\" \"Moderate,\" and \"Severe.\" The top three features that were found to be most indicative for each severity level are as follows:\n\n**For patients rated as \"Mild\":**\n1. **Has 1 symptom:** This feature indicates the presence of a specific symptom (let's say, symptom X) that is associated with a mild severity rating. If a patient has symptom X, it suggests a higher likelihood of being classified as \"Mild.\"\n2. **Depression:** This feature refers to the presence or absence of depression symptoms in the patient. The presence of depression symptoms is considered important in determining a mild severity rating.\n3. **Has 3 symptoms:** Similar to the previous feature, this feature represents the presence of another symptom (let's call it symptom Y) that is associated with a mild severity rating. If a patient has symptom Y, it suggests a higher likelihood of being classified as \"Mild.\"\n\n**For patients rated as \"Moderate\":**\n1. **Has 3 symptoms:** This feature indicates the presence of symptom Y, which is associated with a moderate severity rating. If a patient has symptom Y, it suggests a higher likelihood of being classified as \"Moderate.\"\n2. **Depression:** The presence or absence of depression symptoms also plays a role in determining a moderate severity rating.\n3. **Cramps:** This feature represents the presence or absence of cramps in the patient. The presence of cramps is considered important in predicting a moderate severity rating.\n\n**For patients rated as \"Severe\":**\n1. **Cramps:** This feature indicates the presence or absence of cramps, which is associated with a severe severity rating. If a patient has cramps, it suggests a higher likelihood of being classified as \"Severe.\"\n2. **Spasms:** This feature refers to the presence or absence of muscle spasms in the patient. The presence of spasms is considered important in predicting a severe severity rating.\n3. **Has 4 symptoms:** This feature represents the presence of another symptom (let's call it symptom Z) that is associated with a severe severity rating. If a patient has symptom Z, it suggests a higher likelihood of being classified as \"Severe.\"\n\nIn summary, the top features identified for each severity level provide insights into the specific symptoms and factors that contribute to determining the severity of a patient's condition. By considering the presence or absence of these features, the model can make predictions about the severity rating of a patient's condition, helping healthcare professionals assess the level of severity and provide appropriate care and treatment.\n\n### Random Forest Model\n\nThe code performs machine learning tasks using a Random Forest model with selected features. Let's go through each step:\n\n1. Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y) using only the top features: The code selects specific features from the dataset based on their importance in predicting the target variable. These features are obtained from the \"top_features\" dictionary, which contains the top three features for each category (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) in the target variable.\n\n2. Encode the target variable using label encoding: The target variable \"Final Category\" is a categorical variable. To use it in the machine learning model, we need to convert it into numeric form. The code uses label encoding, which assigns a unique numeric value to each category in the target variable.\n\n3. Create a random forest model using the top features: The code initializes a Random Forest model with a specific random state. Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.\n\n4. Perform 10-fold cross-validation: The code evaluates the performance of the Random Forest model using a technique called cross-validation. Cross-validation helps estimate how well the model will generalize to new, unseen data. In this case, 10-fold cross-validation is performed, which means the dataset is divided into 10 equal parts (folds). The model is trained and tested 10 times, with each fold serving as the test set once.\n\n5. Print the cross-validation scores: The code prints the cross-validation scores obtained from each fold. These scores indicate how well the model performed on each fold. Additionally, the mean cross-validation score is calculated, which provides an overall measure of the model's performance.\n\n6. Train the model: The code trains the Random Forest model using all the available data, as specified by the features (X) and target variable (y).\n\n7. Make predictions on the training set: The code uses the trained model to make predictions on the same dataset that was used for training. This helps evaluate how well the model can predict the target variable for the given features.\n\n8. Print the confusion matrix: The code prints a confusion matrix, which is a table that shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model. It provides insights into the model's performance for each category in the target variable.\n\n9. Calculate and print other evaluation metrics: The code calculates additional evaluation metrics such as ROC AUC score, recall, precision, and Kappa metric. These metrics help assess the model's performance in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and agreement beyond chance.\n\nOverall, this code builds a Random Forest model using selected features, evaluates its performance through cross-validation, and provides insights into the model's predictive capabilities using various evaluation metrics. The goal is to understand how well the model can predict the categories in the target variable based on the selected features.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y) using only the top features\nX = ds[top_features['Mild'] + top_features['Moderate'] + top_features['Severe']]\ny = ds['Final Category']\n\n# Encode the target variable using label encoding\nlabel_encoder = LabelEncoder()\ny = label_encoder.fit_transform(y)\n\n# Create a random forest model using the top features\nrf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=60)\n\n# Perform 10-fold cross-validation\ncv_scores = cross_val_score(rf_model, X, y, cv=10)\n\n# Print the cross-validation scores\nprint(\"Cross-Validation Scores:\", cv_scores)\nprint(\"Mean CV Score:\", cv_scores.mean())\nprint()\n\n# Train the model\nrf_model.fit(X, y)\n\n# Make predictions on the test set\ny_pred = rf_model.predict(X)\n\n# Print confusion matrix\nprint(\"Confusion Matrix:\")\nprint(confusion_matrix(y, y_pred))\nprint()\n\n# Calculate and print ROC AUC score\nroc_auc = roc_auc_score(y, rf_model.predict_proba(X), multi_class='ovr')\nprint(\"ROC AUC:\", roc_auc)\nprint()\n\n# Calculate and print recall score\nrecall = recall_score(y, y_pred, average='weighted')\nprint(\"Recall:\", recall)\nprint()\n\n# Calculate and print precision score\nprecision = precision_score(y, y_pred, average='weighted')\nprint(\"Precision:\", precision)\nprint()\n\n# Calculate and print Kappa metric\nkappa = cohen_kappa_score(y, y_pred)\nprint(\"Kappa:\", kappa)\nprint()\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCross-Validation Scores: [0.86666667 0.9        1.         0.9        0.96666667 0.9\n 0.86666667 0.8        0.86666667 0.8       ]\nMean CV Score: 0.8866666666666667\n\nConfusion Matrix:\n[[84 13  3]\n [ 1 94  5]\n [ 0  8 92]]\n\nROC AUC: 0.9712833333333334\n\nRecall: 0.9\n\nPrecision: 0.908542199488491\n\nKappa: 0.85\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Metrics Explained\n\nLet's break down the provided metrics based on the given confusion matrix:\n\nConfusion Matrix:\nThe confusion matrix is a table that helps us understand the performance of a classification model. It shows the predicted labels versus the actual labels for each class. In this case, the confusion matrix has three rows and three columns, representing the three severity rating categories.\n\nThe number 84 in the first row and first column indicates that the model correctly predicted 84 patients as \"mild\" when their actual severity rating was also \"mild.\"\nThe number 13 in the first row and second column indicates that the model incorrectly predicted 13 patients as \"moderate\" when their actual severity rating was \"mild.\"\nThe number 3 in the first row and third column indicates that the model incorrectly predicted 3 patients as \"severe\" when their actual severity rating was \"mild.\"\nSimilarly, the other numbers in the matrix represent the model's predictions for the other severity rating categories.\nROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve):\nROC AUC is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between different severity ratings. It represents the overall performance of the model across all severity levels. The value of 0.971 indicates a high level of performance, close to 1, suggesting that the model has good predictive capability for distinguishing between severity ratings.\n\nRecall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positive instances (patients with a particular severity rating) that the model correctly identified. A recall value of 0.9 means that the model identified 90% of the patients with their correct severity rating.\n\nPrecision measures the proportion of instances that the model predicted correctly as positive (patients with a particular severity rating) out of all instances it predicted as positive. A precision value of 0.909 indicates that out of all the patients the model identified as having a specific severity rating, 90.9% of them were correct.\n\nKappa:\nThe Kappa statistic is a measure of agreement between the model's predictions and the actual severity ratings, taking into account the possibility of agreement occurring by chance. A Kappa value of 0.85 indicates a substantial level of agreement between the model's predictions and the actual severity ratings, suggesting a reliable performance of the model.\n\nOverall, these metrics indicate that the model has performed well in predicting the severity ratings of the patients, with high accuracy, good distinction between severity levels, and substantial agreement with the actual severity ratings provided by physicians.\n\n\n### Visualizing Random Forest's Best Decision Tree\n\n::: {.cell .column-screen execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Perform 10-fold cross-validation\ncv_scores = cross_val_score(rf_model, X, y, cv=10)\n\n# Find the index of the best decision tree\nbest_tree_index = np.argmax(cv_scores)\n\n# Get the best decision tree from the random forest\nbest_tree = rf_model.estimators_[best_tree_index]\n\n# Visualize the best decision tree using matplotlib\nplt.figure(figsize=(20, 15))\ntree.plot_tree(best_tree, feature_names=X.columns, class_names=label_encoder.classes_, filled=True)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.png){width=1507 height=1128}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Results\n\n1. If a patient has between 1 to 3 symptoms, and one of those symptoms includes depression, they are classified as 'Mild'.\n\n2. If a patient has at least 3 symptoms, and two of those symptoms are depression and cramps, they are classified as 'Moderate'.\n\n3. Lastly, if a patient has 4 symptoms, and two of those symptoms are cramps and spasms, they are classified as 'Severe'.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study focused on predicting severity levels in patients with a rare disease using a random forest approach based on symptom analysis. The client's goal was to map individual patients to appropriate severity levels, given the absence of established guidelines. By leveraging a comprehensive database containing clinically relevant information and severity ratings provided by physicians, we extracted simple rules to classify patients.\n\nThe study revealed that patients with 1 to 3 symptoms, including depression, were classified as 'Mild'. For patients with at least 3 symptoms, the presence of depression and cramps (at least 2 symptoms) indicated a classification of 'Moderate'. Lastly, patients presenting with 4 symptoms, including cramps and spasms (at least 2 symptoms), were categorized as 'Severe'.\n\nThe derived rules provide valuable insights into the mental heuristics employed by physicians when assessing severity levels in patients. By incorporating these rules into the client's product development, personalized healthcare targeting patients with moderate to severe disease can be enhanced. Furthermore, these findings contribute to filling the existing gap in severity level guidelines for this rare disease.\n\nFurther research can focus on validating and refining these rules using larger datasets and exploring additional factors that may influence severity levels. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of utilizing symptom analysis and a random forest approach to classify patients accurately, facilitating personalized treatment and improving patient outcomes.\n\n",
