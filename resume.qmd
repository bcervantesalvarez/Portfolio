### Background

I come from a background in retail, where I have gained valuable experience in customer service, sales, and inventory management. However, I have always been fascinated by the power of data and its potential to inform business decisions and drive growth. As a result, I have pursued coursework in data science and gained proficiency in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL. I have also completed projects that involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling. My experience in retail has taught me the importance of understanding customer behavior and market trends, and I believe that these insights can be enhanced through the use of data-driven approaches. I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to a career in data science and contribute to an organization that values innovation and data-driven decision-making.

### Goal

My goal as a Data Scientist is to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to a dynamic organization that values innovation and data-driven decision-making. I am seeking a challenging role where I can apply my expertise in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization to solve complex problems and drive business growth. Through my academic coursework and hands-on experience, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, as well as tools and frameworks like Tableau, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. I am excited to continue building my skills and learning from experienced professionals in the industry.
