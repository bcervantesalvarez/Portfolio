### Mathematician by Training, Data Scientist by Passion: My Journey of Self-Discovery

With a solid foundation in mathematics from my Bachelor of Arts degree and nearing completion of my Master's degree in Data Science, I have embarked on an exhilarating path towards becoming a next-generation data scientist. My journey has been fueled by a deep-rooted passion for unraveling insights hidden within data.

Throughout my academic pursuits, I have delved into a multitude of areas, including machine learning and survival analysis, honing my analytical skills and developing a keen eye for patterns and trends. Equipped with the ability to effectively communicate data-driven insights, I strive to bridge the gap between complex datasets and actionable solutions.

My journey has been characterized by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and growth. I am dedicated to staying abreast of the latest advancements in the dynamic field of data science, as I believe that continuous learning is the key to unlocking new possibilities. Embracing challenges with enthusiasm, I am eager to apply my expertise in statistical analysis, data visualization, and problem-solving to tackle real-world complexities.

As I near the culmination of my master's degree, I am poised to embark on a professional career where I can leverage my skills to make a meaningful impact. I am eager to collaborate with experienced professionals in the industry, learn from their expertise, and contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of data science.

My journey as a mathematician-turned-data scientist has been one of self-discovery, empowerment, and unwavering determination. I am excited to forge ahead, armed with a potent combination of mathematical acumen and a passion for data science, ready to create solutions that drive progress and shape a data-powered future.

### From Playgrounds to Algorithms: Charting the Evolution of a Data Science Whiz

I was born in Pasco, Washington, a small city in the southeastern part of the state. Pasco is part of the Tri-Cities area, along with Richland and Kennewick, and is known for its agricultural industry, particularly the cultivation of potatoes, apples, and wine grapes.

I enjoyed the rural atmosphere of Pasco, with its open fields, orchards, and vineyards.

Before finishing 1st grade, I moved to Salem, Oregon, a mid-sized city in the heart of the Willamette Valley. Salem is known for its farms and vineyards that produce some of the best wine and food in the state.

Growing up in Salem, I was immersed in the outdoors and enjoyed activities such as hiking, camping, and running. Salem also has a rich history, with landmarks like the Oregon State Capitol and Willamette University, which is the oldest university in the west. However, as I got older, I also became aware of some of the social and economic challenges faced by many families in the area, such as poverty, limited job opportunities, and inadequate access to healthcare.

My family and I suffered poverty and food instability before I graduated high school. Despite these challenges, I feel a strong connection to Salem and its people, and I am grateful for the experiences and values that I gained from growing up in this community.
