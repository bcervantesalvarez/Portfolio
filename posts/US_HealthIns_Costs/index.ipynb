        "**Graph Two**: Barplot of Average Cost per Child - Similar to the male nonsmokers, there seems to be a trend that having more children will result in higher average insurance costs. - Given the information from the smokers, when an individual has 5 children or more, their insurance costs drops on average. - However, the lowest average comes from having no children at all.\n",

        "**Graph Four**: Scatterplot of Cost vs Age with Children - Strong linear relationship between insurance cost and age. - A secondary trend is shown with the number of children. - The less children, the insurance cost is on the lower end of the linear relationship. - The more children, the insurance cost is on the higher end of the linear relationship - The outliers do not follow the trend line.\n",

        "It is clear that smoking will increase your health insurance charges. Male and female smokers will receive an additional charge for having a BMI equal or greater than 30. Male smokers hitch a 52% increase while female smokers endure a 49% increase. Keep in mind that this apart from their base premium increase for being smokers in the first place. To emphasize, male smokers will approximately be charged 408.57% more than their nonsmoker counterpart. Similarly, female smokers approximately pay 350.12% more than their nonsmoker counterparts. Given the data, it pushes the idea that smoking and being in an unhealthy body mass index will punish those individuals through higher health insurance charges.
