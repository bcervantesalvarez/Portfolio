## Abstract

This paper presents a machine learning study on predicting severity levels in patients using a random forest approach based on symptom analysis. The objective was to develop accurate rules for classifying patients into three severity levels: Mild, Moderate, and Severe. A dataset containing patient symptoms was analyzed, and a random forest model was employed for classification. The top features were explored to derive meaningful rules. The results revealed that patients with 1 to 3 symptoms, including depression, were classified as Mild, while those with at least 3 symptoms, including depression and cramps (at least 2 symptoms), were classified as Moderate. Patients with 4 symptoms, including cramps and spasms (at least 2 symptoms), were classified as Severe. The random forest model achieved promising results, as confirmed by the confusion matrix. This study provides valuable insights into predicting severity levels in patients, facilitating personalized healthcare and treatment planning.

## Introduction

In the field of rare diseases, physicians often observe variations in the severity levels of patients; however, there is a lack of established guidelines to map individual patients directly to specific severity levels. Our client, who is developing a product for this rare disease, aims to target patients with moderate to severe conditions. To address this challenge, the client possesses a comprehensive database containing clinically relevant information about the disease, including symptom flags and a symptom count variable. Additionally, each patient in the database has been rated by a physician as mild, moderate, or severe. The client has approached [REDACTED] with the objective of extracting the mental heuristics employed by physicians when assigning severity labels to patients. The task at hand involves deriving simple rules (1-3 per severity level) from the database that can effectively classify patients. For instance, a set of rules might involve identifying patients as severe if they exhibit fatigue or have exactly two symptoms. By extracting these rules, our aim is to provide the client with a clearer understanding of the factors influencing severity levels in order to enhance their product development and enable more personalized patient care.

### Feature Engineering

The code performs some data preprocessing and feature selection to prepare the data for a Random Forest model. Let's go through each step:

1. Drop the ID column: The code removes a column named "Patient" from the dataset. This column likely contains unique identifiers for each patient, and since it's not relevant for our analysis, we can safely remove it.

2. Create dummy columns for "Number of Symptoms": The code converts a column called "Number of Symptoms" into multiple binary columns, known as dummy variables. Each dummy variable represents a unique value in the original column. This transformation helps us to use categorical data in our machine learning model.

3. Concatenate the dummy columns with the original dataframe: The code combines the newly created dummy columns with the original dataset. This ensures that we retain all the existing information while incorporating the transformed categorical data.

4. Drop the original "Number of Symptoms" column: Since we have created the dummy columns, we no longer need the original "Number of Symptoms" column. Therefore, the code removes this column from the dataset.

5. Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y): The code splits the dataset into two parts. The features, represented by the variable X, contain all the columns except the "Final Category" column, which is the target variable we want to predict. The target variable, represented by the variable y, contains only the "Final Category" column. This is the severity cases of 'Mild', 'Moderate' and 'Severe'

6. Perform feature selection using Random Forest: The code utilizes a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest to identify the most important features for each category in the target variable. It trains a separate Random Forest model for each category and determines the top three features that contribute the most to predicting that category.

7. Store the top features for each category: The code stores the top three features for each category in a dictionary called "top_features." Each category is represented by a label, and the corresponding top features are stored as a list.

8. Print the top 3 features for each label: The code then prints the top three features for each category in the target variable. This information helps us understand which features are most influential in determining the predicted category.

Overall, this code prepares the data by transforming categorical data into a suitable format and identifies the top features that contribute to predicting different categories. This sets the stage for further analysis and building the final machine learning model based on these selected features.


```{python}
#| column: screen
# Drop the ID column
ds.drop('Patient', axis=1, inplace=True)

# Create dummy columns from the "Number of Symptoms" column
dummy_cols = pd.get_dummies(ds['Number of Symptoms'], prefix='Symptom')

# Concatenate the dummy columns with the original dataframe
ds = pd.concat([ds, dummy_cols], axis=1)

# Drop the original "Number of Symptoms" column
ds.drop('Number of Symptoms', axis=1, inplace=True)

ds.head(10)
```


```{python}
#| column: page
# Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y)
X = ds.drop('Final Category', axis=1)
y = ds['Final Category']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize a dictionary to store top features per label
top_features = {}

# Perform feature selection for each label
for label in y_train.unique():
    # Encode the target variable for the current label
    y_label_train = (y_train == label).astype(int)
    y_label_test = (y_test == label).astype(int)
    
    # Create a Random Forest model
    rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=60)
    
    # Train the model
    rf_model.fit(X_train, y_label_train)
    
    # Get feature importances
    feature_importances = rf_model.feature_importances_
    
    # Sort features by importance in descending order
    sorted_features = sorted(zip(X_train.columns, feature_importances), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Get the top 3 features for the current label
    selected_features = [feature for feature, _ in sorted_features[:3]]
    
    # Store the top features for the current label
    top_features[label] = selected_features

# Print the top 3 features for each label
for label, features in top_features.items():
    print(f"Top 3 features for {label}:")
    print(features)
    print()
```

#### Features Explained

The feature selection process aims to identify the most important factors (features) that contribute to determining the severity of a patient's condition. In this case, the severity levels are categorized as "Mild," "Moderate," and "Severe." The top three features that were found to be most indicative for each severity level are as follows:

**For patients rated as "Mild":**
1. **Has 1 symptom:** This feature indicates the presence of a specific symptom (let's say, symptom X) that is associated with a mild severity rating. If a patient has symptom X, it suggests a higher likelihood of being classified as "Mild."
2. **Depression:** This feature refers to the presence or absence of depression symptoms in the patient. The presence of depression symptoms is considered important in determining a mild severity rating.
3. **Has 3 symptoms:** Similar to the previous feature, this feature represents the presence of another symptom (let's call it symptom Y) that is associated with a mild severity rating. If a patient has symptom Y, it suggests a higher likelihood of being classified as "Mild."

**For patients rated as "Moderate":**
1. **Has 3 symptoms:** This feature indicates the presence of symptom Y, which is associated with a moderate severity rating. If a patient has symptom Y, it suggests a higher likelihood of being classified as "Moderate."
2. **Depression:** The presence or absence of depression symptoms also plays a role in determining a moderate severity rating.
3. **Cramps:** This feature represents the presence or absence of cramps in the patient. The presence of cramps is considered important in predicting a moderate severity rating.

**For patients rated as "Severe":**
1. **Cramps:** This feature indicates the presence or absence of cramps, which is associated with a severe severity rating. If a patient has cramps, it suggests a higher likelihood of being classified as "Severe."
2. **Spasms:** This feature refers to the presence or absence of muscle spasms in the patient. The presence of spasms is considered important in predicting a severe severity rating.
3. **Has 4 symptoms:** This feature represents the presence of another symptom (let's call it symptom Z) that is associated with a severe severity rating. If a patient has symptom Z, it suggests a higher likelihood of being classified as "Severe."

In summary, the top features identified for each severity level provide insights into the specific symptoms and factors that contribute to determining the severity of a patient's condition. By considering the presence or absence of these features, the model can make predictions about the severity rating of a patient's condition, helping healthcare professionals assess the level of severity and provide appropriate care and treatment.

### Random Forest Model

The code performs machine learning tasks using a Random Forest model with selected features. Let's go through each step:

1. Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y) using only the top features: The code selects specific features from the dataset based on their importance in predicting the target variable. These features are obtained from the "top_features" dictionary, which contains the top three features for each category (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) in the target variable.

2. Encode the target variable using label encoding: The target variable "Final Category" is a categorical variable. To use it in the machine learning model, we need to convert it into numeric form. The code uses label encoding, which assigns a unique numeric value to each category in the target variable.

3. Create a random forest model using the top features: The code initializes a Random Forest model with a specific random state. Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

4. Perform 10-fold cross-validation: The code evaluates the performance of the Random Forest model using a technique called cross-validation. Cross-validation helps estimate how well the model will generalize to new, unseen data. In this case, 10-fold cross-validation is performed, which means the dataset is divided into 10 equal parts (folds). The model is trained and tested 10 times, with each fold serving as the test set once.

5. Print the cross-validation scores: The code prints the cross-validation scores obtained from each fold. These scores indicate how well the model performed on each fold. Additionally, the mean cross-validation score is calculated, which provides an overall measure of the model's performance.

6. Train the model: The code trains the Random Forest model using all the available data, as specified by the features (X) and target variable (y).

7. Make predictions on the training set: The code uses the trained model to make predictions on the same dataset that was used for training. This helps evaluate how well the model can predict the target variable for the given features.

8. Print the confusion matrix: The code prints a confusion matrix, which is a table that shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model. It provides insights into the model's performance for each category in the target variable.

9. Calculate and print other evaluation metrics: The code calculates additional evaluation metrics such as ROC AUC score, recall, precision, and Kappa metric. These metrics help assess the model's performance in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and agreement beyond chance.

Overall, this code builds a Random Forest model using selected features, evaluates its performance through cross-validation, and provides insights into the model's predictive capabilities using various evaluation metrics. The goal is to understand how well the model can predict the categories in the target variable based on the selected features.

```{python}
#| column: page
# Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y) using only the top features
X = ds[top_features['Mild'] + top_features['Moderate'] + top_features['Severe']]
y = ds['Final Category']

# Encode the target variable using label encoding
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
y = label_encoder.fit_transform(y)

# Create a random forest model using the top features
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=60)

# Perform 10-fold cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(rf_model, X, y, cv=10)

# Print the cross-validation scores
print("Cross-Validation Scores:", cv_scores)
print("Mean CV Score:", cv_scores.mean())
print()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 87)

# Train the model
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Print confusion matrix
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print()

# Calculate and print ROC AUC score
roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, rf_model.predict_proba(X_test), multi_class='ovr')
print("ROC AUC:", roc_auc)
print()

# Calculate and print recall score
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')
print("Recall:", recall)
print()

# Calculate and print precision score
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')
print("Precision:", precision)
print()

# Calculate and print Kappa metric
kappa = cohen_kappa_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Kappa:", kappa)
print()


```


#### Metrics Explained

Let's break down the provided metrics based on the given confusion matrix:

Confusion Matrix:
The confusion matrix is a table that helps us understand the performance of a classification model. It shows the predicted labels versus the actual labels for each class. In this case, the confusion matrix has three rows and three columns, representing the three severity rating categories.


$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
& {\text{Actual}} \\ 
\text{Predicted} & \text{Mild} & \text{Moderate} & \text{Severe} \\
\hline
\text{Mild} & 18 & 4 & 0 \\
\text{Moderate} & 0 & 19 & 2 \\
\text{Severe} & 0 & 1 & 16 \\
\end{array}
$$


The number 18 in the first row and first column indicates that the model correctly predicted 84 patients as "mild" when their actual severity rating was also "mild." The number 4 in the first row and second column indicates that the model incorrectly predicted 4 patients as "moderate" when their actual severity rating was "mild." The number 0 in the first row and third column indicates that the model correctly predicted 0 patients as being "severe", meaning that those patients were labeled correctly as "mild"

Similarly, the other numbers in the matrix represent the model's predictions for the other severity rating categories. ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve): ROC AUC is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between different severity ratings. It represents the overall performance of the model across all severity levels. The value of 0.945 indicates a high level of performance, close to 1, suggesting that the model has good predictive capability for distinguishing between severity ratings.


#### ROC Curve
```{python}

# Calculate predicted probabilities for each class
y_pred_proba = rf_model.predict_proba(X_test)

# Compute the ROC curve for each class
fpr = dict()
tpr = dict()
roc_auc = dict()
for class_index in range(len(label_encoder.classes_)):
    fpr[class_index], tpr[class_index], _ = roc_curve(
        (y_test == class_index).astype(int), y_pred_proba[:, class_index]
    )
    roc_auc[class_index] = roc_auc_score(
        (y_test == class_index).astype(int), y_pred_proba[:, class_index]
    )

# Plot the ROC curve for each class
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
for class_index in range(len(label_encoder.classes_)):
    plt.plot(
        fpr[class_index],
        tpr[class_index],
        label=f"Class {label_encoder.classes_[class_index]} (AUC = {roc_auc[class_index]:.2f})",
    )

# Plot random guessing line
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], "k--")

# Set plot properties
plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
plt.xlabel("False Positive Rate")
plt.ylabel("True Positive Rate")
plt.title("Receiver Operating Characteristic")
plt.legend(loc="lower right")

# Show the plot
plt.show()
plt.clf()
plt.close()
plt.show()
```

Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positive instances (patients with a particular severity rating) that the model correctly identified. A recall value of 0.883 means that the model identified nearly 88.3% of the patients with their correct severity rating.

Precision measures the proportion of instances that the model predicted correctly as positive (patients with a particular severity rating) out of all instances it predicted as positive. A precision value of 0.895 indicates that out of all the patients the model identified as having a specific severity rating, 89.5% of them were correct.

#### Recall vs. Precision Curve

```{python}
# Calculate precision and recall values for each class
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_test, rf_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1], pos_label=1)

# Plot the recall vs. precision curve
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(recall, precision, marker='.')
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Recall vs. Precision Curve')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
plt.clf()
plt.close()
plt.show()
```

Kappa:
The Kappa statistic is a measure of agreement between the model's predictions and the actual severity ratings, taking into account the possibility of agreement occurring by chance. A Kappa value of 0.82 indicates a substantial level of agreement between the model's predictions and the actual severity ratings, suggesting a reliable performance of the model.

Overall, these metrics indicate that the model has performed well in predicting the severity ratings of the patients, with high accuracy, good distinction between severity levels, and substantial agreement with the actual severity ratings provided by physicians.


### Visualizing Random Forest's Best Decision Tree
```{python}
#| column: screen

# Perform 10-fold cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(rf_model, X, y, cv=10)

# Find the index of the best decision tree
best_tree_index = np.argmax(cv_scores)

# Get the best decision tree from the random forest
best_tree = rf_model.estimators_[best_tree_index]

# Visualize the best decision tree using matplotlib
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 15))
tree.plot_tree(best_tree, feature_names=X.columns, class_names=label_encoder.classes_, filled=True)

plt.show()

```



## Results

1. If a patient has between 1 to 3 symptoms, and one of those symptoms includes depression, they are classified as 'Mild'.

2. If a patient has at least 3 symptoms, and two of those symptoms are depression and cramps, they are classified as 'Moderate'.

3. Lastly, if a patient has 4 symptoms, and two of those symptoms are cramps and spasms, they are classified as 'Severe'.

## Conclusion

This study focused on predicting severity levels in patients with a rare disease using a random forest approach based on symptom analysis. The client's goal was to map individual patients to appropriate severity levels, given the absence of established guidelines. By leveraging a comprehensive database containing clinically relevant information and severity ratings provided by physicians, we extracted simple rules to classify patients.

The study revealed that patients with 1 to 3 symptoms, including depression, were classified as 'Mild'. For patients with at least 3 symptoms, the presence of depression and cramps (at least 2 symptoms) indicated a classification of 'Moderate'. Lastly, patients presenting with 4 symptoms, including cramps and spasms (at least 2 symptoms), were categorized as 'Severe'.

The derived rules provide valuable insights into the mental heuristics employed by physicians when assessing severity levels in patients. By incorporating these rules into the client's product development, personalized healthcare targeting patients with moderate to severe disease can be enhanced. Furthermore, these findings contribute to filling the existing gap in severity level guidelines for this rare disease.

## Further Research

It is recommended to validate and refine these rules using larger datasets. By expanding the dataset, researchers can ensure the generalizability of the derived rules and improve the accuracy of the classification. Additionally, exploring additional factors that may influence severity levels, such as demographic information, medical history, or genetic markers, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease and enhance the prediction models.

By continuing to refine and validate the rules and incorporating more factors into the analysis, personalized treatment for patients with this rare disease can be further optimized, leading to improved patient outcomes. The combination of symptom analysis and machine learning approaches holds significant potential for facilitating accurate classification and personalized healthcare in various medical domains.
