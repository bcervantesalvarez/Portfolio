## Abstract

This project aims to utilize R's plotly package to create dynamic and interactive visualizations of Time Series Graphs. The focus of the analysis is on the Apple stock prices from 1981 to the present, with a specific emphasis on identifying notable trends that have emerged over time. The study reveals a significant spike in the company's stock prices following 2010, attributed to the success of Apple's iPhone and related products. The research also highlights the impact of Apple's marketing strategy in maintaining its market value and relevance to changing consumer needs. Overall, the project demonstrates the insightful use of R's plotly for visualizing Time Series Graphs and providing meaningful explanations of stock market trends.

## Introduction

Visualizing Time Series Graphs using R's plotly package provides a powerful means to analyze and interpret complex data. In this project, the focus is on exploring the Apple stock prices over several decades and identifying key trends that have shaped the company's market performance. The analysis uncovers a significant upsurge in Apple's stock prices after 2010, which can be attributed to the tremendous success of the iPhone and Apple's ability to stay in tune with evolving consumer demands.

Furthermore, the research recognizes the role of Apple's marketing strategy in maintaining the company's market value and driving its growth. Apple's innovative technology and ability to revolutionize the tech industry have contributed significantly to its economic impact. By employing R's plotly package, this project aims to provide a more meaningful and interactive representation of the Time Series Graphs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the trends in the stock market.

## Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
```

```{r}
ds <- read_csv("AppleInc_Stocks.csv")
#head(ds)
```

## Apply Custom Theme

```{r}
myTheme <- function(){ 
    font <- "SF Mono"   #assign font family up front
    
    theme_minimal() %+replace%    #replace elements we want to change
    
    theme(
      
      #grid elements
      panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),    #strip major gridlines
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),    #strip minor gridlines
      axis.ticks = element_blank(),          #strip axis ticks
      
      #since theme_minimal() already strips axis lines, 
      #we don't need to do that again
      
      #text elements
      plot.title = element_text(             #title
                   family = font,            #set font family
                   size = 16,                #set font size
                   face = 'bold',            #bold typeface
                   hjust = 0,                #left align
                   vjust = 2),               #raise slightly
      
      plot.subtitle = element_text(          #subtitle
                   family = font,            #font family
                   size = 12),               #font size
      
      plot.caption = element_text(           #caption
                   family = font,            #font family
                   size = 9,                 #font size
                   hjust = 1),               #right align
      
      axis.title = element_text(             #axis titles
                   family = font,            #font family
                   size = 10),               #font size
      
      axis.text = element_text(              #axis text
                   family = font,            #axis famuly
                   size = 9),                #font size
      
      axis.text.x = element_text(            #margin for axis text
                    margin=margin(5, b = 10))
      
      #since the legend often requires manual tweaking 
      #based on plot content, don't define it here
    )
}
```

## Data Wrangling

```{r}
yearlyDs <- ds %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, "%m/%d/%Y")) %>%
  group_by(Year = lubridate::floor_date(Date, "year")) %>%
  summarize(Open = mean(Open),
            High = mean(High),
            Low = mean(Low),
            Close = mean(Close),
            AdjClose = mean(`Adj Close`),
            Volume = mean(Volume))


log_yearlyDs <- ds %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, "%m/%d/%Y")) %>%
  group_by(Year = lubridate::floor_date(Date, "year")) %>%
  summarize(Open = log(mean(Open)),
            High = log(mean(High)),
            Low = log(mean(Low)),
            Close = log(mean(Close)),
            AdjClose = log(mean(`Adj Close`)),
            Volume = log(mean(Volume)))

```

## Times Series Plots of Apple Inc. Stock Prices

```{r}
p <- yearlyDs %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = High), color = "green4") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Low), color = "red4") +
  geom_line(aes(y = AdjClose), color = "grey") +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "Apple Inc. Stock Price Since 1981") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  myTheme()

ggplotly(p) %>%
  layout(hovermode = "x unified") %>% 
  style(hovertext = paste0(" High: $", round(yearlyDs$High,2)),
        traces = 1) %>%
  style(hovertext = paste0(" Low: $", round(yearlyDs$Low,2)),
        traces = 2) %>%
  style(hovertext = paste0(" AdjClose: $", round(yearlyDs$AdjClose,2)),
        traces = 3)
  
```

## Applying Log-norm

```{r}
p2 <- log_yearlyDs %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = High), color = "green4") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Low), color = "red4") +
  geom_line(aes(y = AdjClose), color = "grey") +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "Apple Inc. Stock Price (Log-Normalized)") +
  myTheme()

ggplotly(p2, tooltip = "text") %>%
  layout(hovermode = "x unified", 
         hovertext = paste0(" Year: ", log_yearlyDs$Year)) %>% 
  style(hovertext = paste0(" High: ", round(log_yearlyDs$High,2)),
        traces = 1) %>%
  style(hovertext = paste0(" Low: ", round(log_yearlyDs$Low,2)),
        traces = 2) %>%
  style(hovertext = paste0(" AdjClose: ", round(log_yearlyDs$AdjClose,2)),
        traces = 3)

```
