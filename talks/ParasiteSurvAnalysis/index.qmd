## Unveiling Nature's Heatwave: The Hidden Impact of Temperature on Pesticide Toxicity

In this captivating study, we embark on a quest to unravel the influence of temperature on the toxicity of pesticides, driven by growing concerns about the effects of climate change. Our mission extends beyond conventional pesticide testing, as we strive to shed light on the potential impacts of varying temperatures. We seek to answer a pivotal question: Does temperature significantly shape pesticide toxicity? To uncover the truth, we employ survival analysis, delving into the realm of time-to-death for the exposed subjects. By deciphering the intricate interplay between temperature and pesticide toxicity, we aim to reveal the magnitude of this effect and its implications for our changing world.
