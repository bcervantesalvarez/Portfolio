    "text": "This project focuses on the medical insurance industry. I demonstrate the ability to provide visualizations and statistical inferences when given a cleaned up data set. Here is the data set source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance\nHere are a few questions I formulated before diving into the data set: What single component causes the most increase in insurance costs? What variables play a role in increasing or decreasing insurance costs? What would be the ideal individual to minimize the cost of medical insurance?\nI look into smokers as being a variable of interest. Additionally, I dive into the difference of between male and female insurance costs for both smokers and nonsmokers.\nIf you wish to skip towards the results portion, feel free to scroll down and have a quick read! Interesting results were found.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n#read in the csv file\ndf = pd.read_csv('insurance.csv')\nprint(df.head())\n\n\n   age     sex     bmi  children smoker     region      charges\n0   19  female  27.900         0    yes  southwest  16884.92400\n1   18    male  33.770         1     no  southeast   1725.55230\n2   28    male  33.000         3     no  southeast   4449.46200\n3   33    male  22.705         0     no  northwest  21984.47061\n4   32    male  28.880         0     no  northwest   3866.85520\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to know what influences the cost of insurance. What causes an individual to pay more for their insurance? We can infer that being a smoker will drastically increase their out of pocket medical insurance expenses.\nI take a look into how many smokers we have in this data set. Then, I take a quick look into the smokers’ distribution of charges and show a boxplot to visualize the insurance cost quartiles. Next, I dive into using some statistics such as finding the min, max, mean, median, etc. I follow up by seperating male and female smokers and seeing if there’s a drastic change in their expenses.\n\n\n\nSmoker Count: 274\nNonsmoker Count: 1064\n\n\n\nCode\n#while a histogram is not necessary, it can really show in the visual count of smokers vs nonsmokers\nplt.figure(figsize = (8, 6))\nsns.set(font_scale = 1.5)\nsns.histplot(df.smoker)\nplt.title('Smoker vs Nonsmoker Count')\n\nplt.tight_layout(pad = 2)\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n\n#num_smokers = df.smoker.value_counts()['yes']\n#num_nonsmokers = df.smoker.value_counts()['no']\n#print(\"Exact number of smokers: {num_smokers}\".format(num_smokers = num_smokers))\n#print(\"Exact number of nonsmokers: {num_nonsmokers}\".format(num_nonsmokers = num_nonsmokers))\n\n\n\n\n\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interquartile range is $20,125.33. Very high spread from the first and third interquartiles.\nNow, notice that we have a bimodal distribution. This means that there is a variable in the data set that is drastically affecting the insurance cost. Since there is two “humps” we must identify the component that causes a further jump in insurance costs for those who smoke.\nWhat could cause this? - Region? - Bmi? - Sex? - Children? - Age?\n\n\nCode\ndf_smokers = df[df.smoker == 'yes']\n#print(df_smokers.head())\nsns.set(font_scale = 0.8)\nIQR = stats.iqr(df_smokers.charges, interpolation = 'midpoint')\n#print(round(IQR,2))\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,6))\n#boxplot\nsns.boxplot(y = df_smokers.charges, ax = ax1)\nax1.set_ylabel('Insurance cost (USD)')\nax1.set_title('Insurance Cost Boxplot for Smokers')\n\n#histogram\nsns.histplot(df_smokers.charges, bins = 40, ax = ax2)\nax2.set_xlabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\nax2.set_title('Insurance Cost Distribution for Smokers')\n\nplt.tight_layout(pad = 3)\n\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n\n\n\n\n\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Stats: - Mean: $32,050.23 - Median: $34,456.35 - Max: $63,770.43 - Min: $12,829.46 - Standard Deviation: $11,520.47 - Variance: 132721153.14\nGiven the distribution, we can say that the mean represents the true average insurance cost for smokers.\n\n\nCode\n#find mean of insurance cost for smokers\nsmoker_mean = round(np.mean(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The average insurance cost for being a smoker: ${mean}'.format(mean = smoker_mean))\n\n#find median of insurance cost for smokers\nsmoker_median = round(np.median(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The median insurance cost for being a smoker: ${median}'.format(median = smoker_median))\n\n#find standard deviation...\nsmoker_std = round(np.std(df_smokers.charges),2)\n#print('The standard deviation is: ${std}'.format(std = smoker_std))\n\n#let's see the variance\nsmoker_var = round(np.var(df_smokers.charges),2)\n#print('The variance is: {var}'.format(var = smoker_var))\n\n#maximum cost\nsmoker_max = round(np.max(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The maximum insurance cost for being a smoker is: ${max}'.format(max = smoker_max))\n\n#minimum cost\nsmoker_min = round(np.min(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The minimum insurance cost for being a smoker is: ${min}'.format(min = smoker_min))\n\n\n\n\n\nI chose to seperate male and female smokers to see if there was a noticable difference in cost. Notice in the graphs below, that we can easily identify the culprit for the bimodal distribution. The BMI drastically influences the insurance cost when it is greater than or equal to 30 (the obese rating starts at 30 forward). This means that being obese AND being a smoker can sharply increase your medical insurance cost.\nNote: As Age slowly increases, the insurance cost also slowly increases. So, there is a gradual increase in insurance cost as you age. That is common sense since as one ages, one develops more health issues as they near death.\n\n\n\nGraph One: Cost Distribution - Bimodal Distribution is again present. - Two clusters of cost are due to an underlying variable.\nGraph Two: Barplot of Average Cost per Child - No clear trend. - Only valuable note is that having 4 children seems to have an overall lower average insurance cost.\nGraph Three: Scatterplot of Cost vs BMI with Region - There is a visable linear relationship between BMI and Cost. - There are two clusters of individuals but follows the linear relationship. - At >=30 BMI, there is a clear signifcant increase in insurance cost for male smokers. - Note: a BMI of 30 or implies that the individual is “obese” (though, BMI is not necessarily a good measurement–see results). - No trends with the region.\nGraph Four: Scatterplot of Cost vs Age with Children - There is a linear trend, but split into two linear clusters. - As found earlier, this is most likely due to BMI differences in the indivduals. - Overtime, an individual’s insurance cost will increase as expected.\nGraph Five: Barplot of Average Cost per Region - No valuable insights can be drawn.\nGraph Six: Boxplot of Male Smoker Insurance Cost - Noteworthy to see the spread of male smokers’ insurance cost.\n\n\nCode\n#seperate all male smokers from the main data set\ndf_male_smoker = df_smokers[df_smokers.sex == 'male']\ndf_nonsmokers = df[df.smoker == 'no']\n#print(df_nonsmokers.head())\n#print(df_male_smoker.head())\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2,3,figsize=(10,6))\nsns.set_style('darkgrid')\nsns.set(font_scale = 0.5)\n\n#histogram male smoker\nsns.histplot(df_male_smoker.charges, bins = 40, ax = ax[0,0])\nax[0,0].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost Distribution')\nax[0,0].set_xlabel('Insurnance Cost (USD)')\n\n#barplot for insurance cost of male smokers per child\ndf_children = df_male_smoker.groupby('children').mean().reset_index()\n#print(df_children.head())\n\nsns.barplot(x = df_children.children, y = df_children.charges, ax = ax[0,1])\nax[0,1].set_title('Average Male Smoker Insurance Cost Per Child')\nax[0,1].set_xlabel('Number of Children')\nax[0,1].set_ylabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\n#scatterplot for insurance cost of male smokers by BMI\nsns.scatterplot(x = df_male_smoker.bmi, y = df_male_smoker.charges,\n                hue = df_male_smoker.region,\n                size = df_male_smoker.region,\n                sizes = (7.5, 25), ax = ax[0,2])\nax[0,2].axvline(x = 30, color = 'gray', label = 'Obese BMI')\nax[0,2].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost vs BMI')\nax[0,2].set_xlabel('BMI')\nax[0,2].set_ylabel('Insurance Costs (USD)')\n\n#scatterplot for insurance cost of male smokers by age\nsns.scatterplot(x = df_male_smoker.age, y = df_male_smoker.charges,\n                hue = df_male_smoker.children,\n                size = df_male_smoker.children, sizes = (12.5,25),\n                ax = ax[1,0])\nax[1,0].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost vs Age')\nax[1,0].set_xlabel('Age')\nax[1,0].set_ylabel('Insurance Costs (USD)')\n\n#barplot for insurance cost of male smokers per region\ndf_region = df_male_smoker.groupby('region').mean().reset_index()\n#print(df_region.head())\n\nsns.barplot(x = df_region.region,  y = df_region.charges, ax = ax[1,1])\nax[1,1].set_title('Average Male Smoker Insurance Cost Per Region')\nax[1,1].set_xlabel('Region')\nax[1,1].set_ylabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\n#boxplot of male smoker boxplot\nsns.boxplot(x = df_male_smoker.charges, ax = ax[1,2])\nax[1,2].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost Boxplot')\nax[1,2].set_xlabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\nplt.tight_layout(pad = 4)\n\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n\n\n\n\n\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the reason why the cost distribution had two clusters was due to the difference in BMI in each male smoker.

The outliers do not follow the trend line.\nGraph Five: Barplot of Average Cost per Region - No valuable insights can be drawn. - Some regions are simply cheaper than others.\nGraph Six: Boxplot of Male Smoker Insurance Cost - Noteworthy to see the spread of male smokers’ insurance cost.\n\n\nCode\n#seperate all male nonsmokers from the main data set\ndf_male_nonsmoker = df_nonsmokers[df_nonsmokers.sex == 'male']\n\n#print(male_nonsmoker.head())\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2,3,figsize=(10,6))\nsns.set_style('darkgrid')\nsns.set(font_scale = 0.5)\n\n#histogram male nonsmoker\nsns.histplot(df_male_nonsmoker.charges, bins = 40, ax = ax[0,0])\nax[0,0].set_title('Male Nonsmoker Insurance Cost Distribution')\nax[0,0].set_xlabel('Insurnance Cost (USD)')\n\n#barplot for insurance cost of male nonsmokers per child\ndf_children = df_male_nonsmoker.groupby('children').mean().reset_index()\nsns.barplot(x = df_children.children, y = df_children.charges, ax = ax[0,1])\nax[0,1].set_title('Average Male Nonsmoker Insurance Cost Per Child')\nax[0,1].set_xlabel('Number of Children')\nax[0,1].set_ylabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\n#scatterplot for insurance cost of male nonsmokers by BMI\nsns.scatterplot(x = df_male_nonsmoker.bmi, y = df_male_nonsmoker.charges,\n                hue = df_male_nonsmoker.region,\n                size = df_male_nonsmoker.region,\n                sizes = (7.5, 25), ax = ax[0,2])\nax[0,2].axvline(x = 30, color = 'gray', label = 'Obese BMI')\nax[0,2].set_title('Male Nonsmoker Insurance Cost vs BMI')\nax[0,2].set_xlabel('BMI')\nax[0,2].set_ylabel('Insurance Costs (USD)')\n\n#scatterplot for insurance cost of male nonsmokers by age\nsns.scatterplot(x = df_male_nonsmoker.age, y = df_male_nonsmoker.charges,\n                hue = df_male_nonsmoker.children,\n                size = df_male_nonsmoker.children, sizes = (12.5,25),\n                ax = ax[1,0])\nax[1,0].set_title('Male Nonsmoker Insurance Cost vs Age')\nax[1,0].set_xlabel('Age')\nax[1,0].set_ylabel('Insurance Costs (USD)')\n\n#barplot for insurance cost of male nonsmokers per region\ndf_region = df_male_nonsmoker.groupby('region').mean().reset_index()\nsns.barplot(x = df_region.region,  y = df_region.charges, ax = ax[1,1])\nax[1,1].set_title('Average Male Nonsmoker Insurance Cost Per Region')\nax[1,1].set_xlabel('Region')\nax[1,1].set_ylabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\n#boxplot of male nonsmoker boxplot\nsns.boxplot(x = df_male_nonsmoker.charges, ax = ax[1,2])\nax[1,2].set_title('Male Nonsmoker Insurance Cost Boxplot')\nax[1,2].set_xlabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\nplt.tight_layout(pad = 4)\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n\n\n\n\n\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#highlight scatter plot for linear trend\n\nsns.set(font_scale = 0.8)\nplt.figure(figsize = (8, 6))\nsns.scatterplot(x = df_male_nonsmoker.age, y = df_male_nonsmoker.charges,\n                hue = df_male_nonsmoker.children,\n                size = df_male_nonsmoker.children,\n                sizes = (7.5, 20))\nplt.title('Male Nonsmoker Insurance Cost vs Age')\nplt.xlabel('Age')\nplt.ylabel('Insurance Costs (USD)')\nplt.legend(bbox_to_anchor = (1.0, 1))\n\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n#highlight this\n#solid evidence that as age increases, your insurance cost increases as well.\n#people with more children see a slightly higher cost overall \n\n\n\n\n\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph One: Cost Distribution - Right-skewed distribution is again present. - Knowing this, we should go with the median as the most appropriate statistic instead of the mean.\nGraph Two: Barplot of Average Cost per Child - Similar to the male nonsmokers, there seems to be a trend that having more children will result in higher average insurance costs. - Given the information from the smokers, when an individual has 5 children or more, their insurance costs drops on average. - However, the lowest average comes from having no children at all.\nGraph Three: Scatterplot of Cost vs BMI with Region - Again, there is no correlation between cost and BMI of nonsmokers. - No trends with the region.\nGraph Four: Scatterplot of Cost vs Age with Children - Strong linear relationship between insurance cost and age. -

The outliers do not follow the trend line.\nGraph Five: Barplot of Average Cost per Region - There is a slight trend of region importance. - The northeast is more expensive on average than the southwest.\nGraph Six: Boxplot of Male Smoker Insurance Cost -

    "text": "Summary:\nThe interactive visualization has 4 parts to it. The salary, tuition, debt estimators, and debt calculator. The first one explores the majors their potential salaries. A prospective student may want to see their choices and what their salary could line up during their career. Next, the tuition estimator explores a generalized tuition cost for the students exploring their major in their state of choice. Thirdly, the debt estimator looks into your potential 4-year degree debt based on your family’s income. It is an average of all the students for each university, but it still is a good indicator of how much debt a student will accumulate for their 4 years. Lastly, the final tool looks at how long a student will be in debt according to their major category of choice. In this visual, you can also see how long their projected student debts will last. In essense, this tool is another great tool to help out students in high school who are interested in going into higher education."

    "text": "ABSTRACT\nU.S. Healthcare costs are increasing in every category since 1980. There are an unfiltered number of reasons for the rise of these costs. From population increase to doctor’s wages, they are but a few examples of the unforgiving healthcare spending increases that are observed in a yearly basis. This report examines the expenditure trends from 1980 to 2005 and up to 2014. The results show that each sector in the United States is experiencing an unprecedented increase in health care costs. Hence, the findings revealed in this report serve to provide context behind the United States’ status as one the most expensive health care nations in the world."

Instead of being in the long format, with few columns and lengthy rows, it was in the wide format, lots of columns and very few rows. Specifically, the years were in the format, “Y####” which made it very difficult to do any sort of analysis at first. Though, with some pivoting and string manipulation, the updated data set was ready to do some quirky analysis. The full step process is coming up next."

I used the “gsub” function to fix up my Year column and factored a few columns for later use.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  Item                 Region_Name   State_Name  Year   Cost\n  <fct>                <fct>         <fct>      <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 Personal Health Care United States <NA>        1980 216977\n2 Personal Health Care United States <NA>        1981 251789\n3 Personal Health Care United States <NA>        1982 283073\n4 Personal Health Care United States <NA>        1983 311677\n5 Personal Health Care United States <NA>        1984 341645\n6 Personal Health Care United States <NA>        1985 376376\n\n\n\nHealth Care Costs Have Increased\nDiving straight into the first visual. It appears very clearly that Healthcare spending is in an upward trend and does not appear to slow down. The graph was filter from the years 1980 to 2005 to highlight this era of healthcare costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal, Hospital and Physician & Clinical Care Are The Dominate Spending Categories\nYikes. Personal health care went from about $10K to nearly $80K in that short time span. Hospital and Clinical Care are heavy hitters for spending. Though this graph shows the same trend for each category. Not very pleasant information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Region Is Trending The Same\nTerrible news, each region has not stopped increasing spending. Their trend lines all appear to be similar and proportionally alike to one and another. The highlights are that the Mideast is the most expensive and the Rocky Mountains is the cheapest. Note, this was looking at the spending up to 2005. Maybe things will change by 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trends Remain. Healthcare Spending Continues To Raise In Every Region In The U.S.\nIn the bar chart, you can distinguish more clearly each region and their overall spending. What stands out the most is that the Plains, New England and the Rocky Mountains are one of the lowest in terms of medical funding. In some cases, they are 1/3 the cost of the most expensive regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Far West Ranks 3rd In Healthcare Spending\nFor 2014, that is quite the jump. It can be assumed that all those states are heavy hitters in terms of spending, but that is proven quite wrong in the next graphic.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"$21.81M\"\n[1] \"$21.81M\"\n\n\n\n\nOregon Ranks 3rd, But Don’t Be Fooled!\nLook, California takes the #1 spot in spending. You cannot deny the underlying reasons behind that, such as their ridicously population size. While this report did not look into it, you would probably push the Far West region closer to the Plains or New England in terms of spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"$1.41M\"  \"$53.64M\" \"$1.9M\"   \"$3.41M\"  \"$5.81M\"  \"$10.16M\"\n[1] \"$1.41M\"  \"$53.64M\" \"$1.9M\"   \"$3.41M\"  \"$5.81M\"  \"$10.16M\"\n[1] \"$5.81M\"\n[1] \"$5.81M\"\n\n\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n\n\nA Linear Fit Is Not The Right Model For This Data\nRight off the bat, the model appears to have an adjusted R-Squared value of 0.8572. That looks wondeful, right? No! This model is not accurate at all and is highly discouraged. It becomes clear that their is no correlation between Cost and Region_Name per Year. While not shown, this was true for the filtered data set that went up from 1980 to 2014. The residual plots speak for themselves. The Residuals vs Fitted was showing clear signs of being a quadratic fit instead of a linear one. The Q-Q was short of linear but had a number of curves along the fitted line. The scale location evidently showed that this model was simple not the correct fit for this data.\n======= ### A Linear Fit Is Not The Right Model For This Data\nRight off the bat, the model appears to have an adjusted R-Squared value of 0.8572.

I actually started off using a LeveneTest to see if the variance (the spread of the spending for each region) was important. Given both tests yielded an extremely small p-value, it is clear that there are 3 regions that have a completely different variance than the other regions. I was not done there, I now wanted to confirm this with the TukeyHsd test to see if their means differed as a result. Yes, their means differed as expected from the LeveneTest. To make clear, New England, Plains and Rocky Mountains spent much lower on average. Despite that fact, they are following the trend of growth with an 18% since 2005.\n=======\nI wished to explore if it was statistically significant on where each region’s mean over the years mattered.

    "text": "RESULTS\nU.S. Healthcare costs have more than quintupled from 1980 to 2014. There are trends throughout each region that show no clear indication of healthcare spending going down. While some regions are not as expensive as others, they are still growing at the same pace nationally. Following the trend, personal health care spending averaged approximately $10,000 in 1980, but has substantially increased to nearly $80,000 in 2014. The top 3 most expensive regions as of 2014 are the Mideast, Great Lakes, and Far West. The top 3 least cheapest regions as of 2014 are the Rocky Mountains, New England, and Plains. In the Far West region, Oregon ranks 3rd in being the most expensive State in the region."

Though, in some categories such as Personal Health Care, you could argue that it is becoming increasingly unaffordable. A $70K difference in 35 years is quite off from inflation expectations. Speaking of inflation, this dataset would have had great potential if inflation adjusted values were given. In that sense, a deeper analysis could be made and more insight would have been gained. Now, one could explore this with even more in depth see if there is any statistical significance between each individual state and their spending habits. That is left and open for anyone to undertake in the future. <<<<<<< HEAD =======\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nddc2eb489105b63ec4d6e823ed0c196d9012c65a"
