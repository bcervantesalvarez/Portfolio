    "text": "This project focuses on the medical insurance industry. I demonstrate the ability to provide visualizations and statistical inferences when given a cleaned up data set. Here is the data set source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance\nHere are a few questions I formulated before diving into the data set: What single component causes the most increase in insurance costs? What variables play a role in increasing or decreasing insurance costs? What would be the ideal individual to minimize the cost of medical insurance?\nI look into smokers as being a variable of interest. Additionally, I dive into the difference of between male and female insurance costs for both smokers and nonsmokers.\nIf you wish to skip towards the results portion, feel free to scroll down and have a quick read! Interesting results were found.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n#read in the csv file\ndf = pd.read_csv('insurance.csv')\nprint(df.head())\n\n\n   age     sex     bmi  children smoker     region      charges\n0   19  female  27.900         0    yes  southwest  16884.92400\n1   18    male  33.770         1     no  southeast   1725.55230\n2   28    male  33.000         3     no  southeast   4449.46200\n3   33    male  22.705         0     no  northwest  21984.47061\n4   32    male  28.880         0     no  northwest   3866.85520\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to know what influences the cost of insurance. What causes an individual to pay more for their insurance? We can infer that being a smoker will drastically increase their out of pocket medical insurance expenses.\nI take a look into how many smokers we have in this data set. Then, I take a quick look into the smokers’ distribution of charges and show a boxplot to visualize the insurance cost quartiles. Next, I dive into using some statistics such as finding the min, max, mean, median, etc. I follow up by seperating male and female smokers and seeing if there’s a drastic change in their expenses.\n\n\n\nSmoker Count: 274\nNonsmoker Count: 1064\n\n\n\nCode\n#while a histogram is not necessary, it can really show in the visual count of smokers vs nonsmokers\nplt.figure(figsize = (8, 6))\nsns.set(font_scale = 1.5)\nsns.histplot(df.smoker)\nplt.title('Smoker vs Nonsmoker Count')\n\nplt.tight_layout(pad = 2)\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n\n#num_smokers = df.smoker.value_counts()['yes']\n#num_nonsmokers = df.smoker.value_counts()['no']\n#print(\"Exact number of smokers: {num_smokers}\".format(num_smokers = num_smokers))\n#print(\"Exact number of nonsmokers: {num_nonsmokers}\".format(num_nonsmokers = num_nonsmokers))\n\n\n\n\n\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interquartile range is $20,125.33. Very high spread from the first and third interquartiles.\nNow, notice that we have a bimodal distribution. This means that there is a variable in the data set that is drastically affecting the insurance cost. Since there is two “humps” we must identify the component that causes a further jump in insurance costs for those who smoke.\nWhat could cause this? - Region? - Bmi? - Sex? - Children? - Age?\n\n\nCode\ndf_smokers = df[df.smoker == 'yes']\n#print(df_smokers.head())\nsns.set(font_scale = 0.8)\nIQR = stats.iqr(df_smokers.charges, interpolation = 'midpoint')\n#print(round(IQR,2))\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,6))\n#boxplot\nsns.boxplot(y = df_smokers.charges, ax = ax1)\nax1.set_ylabel('Insurance cost (USD)')\nax1.set_title('Insurance Cost Boxplot for Smokers')\n\n#histogram\nsns.histplot(df_smokers.charges, bins = 40, ax = ax2)\nax2.set_xlabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\nax2.set_title('Insurance Cost Distribution for Smokers')\n\nplt.tight_layout(pad = 3)\n\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n\n\n\n\n\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Stats: - Mean: $32,050.23 - Median: $34,456.35 - Max: $63,770.43 - Min: $12,829.46 - Standard Deviation: $11,520.47 - Variance: 132721153.14\nGiven the distribution, we can say that the mean represents the true average insurance cost for smokers.\n\n\nCode\n#find mean of insurance cost for smokers\nsmoker_mean = round(np.mean(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The average insurance cost for being a smoker: ${mean}'.format(mean = smoker_mean))\n\n#find median of insurance cost for smokers\nsmoker_median = round(np.median(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The median insurance cost for being a smoker: ${median}'.format(median = smoker_median))\n\n#find standard deviation...\nsmoker_std = round(np.std(df_smokers.charges),2)\n#print('The standard deviation is: ${std}'.format(std = smoker_std))\n\n#let's see the variance\nsmoker_var = round(np.var(df_smokers.charges),2)\n#print('The variance is: {var}'.format(var = smoker_var))\n\n#maximum cost\nsmoker_max = round(np.max(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The maximum insurance cost for being a smoker is: ${max}'.format(max = smoker_max))\n\n#minimum cost\nsmoker_min = round(np.min(df_smokers.charges), 2)\n#print('The minimum insurance cost for being a smoker is: ${min}'.format(min = smoker_min))\n\n\n\n\n\nI chose to seperate male and female smokers to see if there was a noticable difference in cost. Notice in the graphs below, that we can easily identify the culprit for the bimodal distribution. The BMI drastically influences the insurance cost when it is greater than or equal to 30 (the obese rating starts at 30 forward). This means that being obese AND being a smoker can sharply increase your medical insurance cost.\nNote: As Age slowly increases, the insurance cost also slowly increases. So, there is a gradual increase in insurance cost as you age. That is common sense since as one ages, one develops more health issues as they near death.\n\n\n\nGraph One: Cost Distribution - Bimodal Distribution is again present. - Two clusters of cost are due to an underlying variable.\nGraph Two: Barplot of Average Cost per Child - No clear trend. - Only valuable note is that having 4 children seems to have an overall lower average insurance cost.\nGraph Three: Scatterplot of Cost vs BMI with Region - There is a visable linear relationship between BMI and Cost. - There are two clusters of individuals but follows the linear relationship. - At >=30 BMI, there is a clear signifcant increase in insurance cost for male smokers. - Note: a BMI of 30 or implies that the individual is “obese” (though, BMI is not necessarily a good measurement–see results). - No trends with the region.\nGraph Four: Scatterplot of Cost vs Age with Children - There is a linear trend, but split into two linear clusters. - As found earlier, this is most likely due to BMI differences in the indivduals. - Overtime, an individual’s insurance cost will increase as expected.\nGraph Five: Barplot of Average Cost per Region - No valuable insights can be drawn.\nGraph Six: Boxplot of Male Smoker Insurance Cost - Noteworthy to see the spread of male smokers’ insurance cost.\n\n\nCode\n#seperate all male smokers from the main data set\ndf_male_smoker = df_smokers[df_smokers.sex == 'male']\ndf_nonsmokers = df[df.smoker == 'no']\n#print(df_nonsmokers.head())\n#print(df_male_smoker.head())\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2,3,figsize=(10,6))\nsns.set_style('darkgrid')\nsns.set(font_scale = 0.5)\n\n#histogram male smoker\nsns.histplot(df_male_smoker.charges, bins = 40, ax = ax[0,0])\nax[0,0].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost Distribution')\nax[0,0].set_xlabel('Insurnance Cost (USD)')\n\n#barplot for insurance cost of male smokers per child\ndf_children = df_male_smoker.groupby('children').mean().reset_index()\n#print(df_children.head())\n\nsns.barplot(x = df_children.children, y = df_children.charges, ax = ax[0,1])\nax[0,1].set_title('Average Male Smoker Insurance Cost Per Child')\nax[0,1].set_xlabel('Number of Children')\nax[0,1].set_ylabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\n#scatterplot for insurance cost of male smokers by BMI\nsns.scatterplot(x = df_male_smoker.bmi, y = df_male_smoker.charges,\n                hue = df_male_smoker.region,\n                size = df_male_smoker.region,\n                sizes = (7.5, 25), ax = ax[0,2])\nax[0,2].axvline(x = 30, color = 'gray', label = 'Obese BMI')\nax[0,2].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost vs BMI')\nax[0,2].set_xlabel('BMI')\nax[0,2].set_ylabel('Insurance Costs (USD)')\n\n#scatterplot for insurance cost of male smokers by age\nsns.scatterplot(x = df_male_smoker.age, y = df_male_smoker.charges,\n                hue = df_male_smoker.children,\n                size = df_male_smoker.children, sizes = (12.5,25),\n                ax = ax[1,0])\nax[1,0].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost vs Age')\nax[1,0].set_xlabel('Age')\nax[1,0].set_ylabel('Insurance Costs (USD)')\n\n#barplot for insurance cost of male smokers per region\ndf_region = df_male_smoker.groupby('region').mean().reset_index()\n#print(df_region.head())\n\nsns.barplot(x = df_region.region,  y = df_region.charges, ax = ax[1,1])\nax[1,1].set_title('Average Male Smoker Insurance Cost Per Region')\nax[1,1].set_xlabel('Region')\nax[1,1].set_ylabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\n#boxplot of male smoker boxplot\nsns.boxplot(x = df_male_smoker.charges, ax = ax[1,2])\nax[1,2].set_title('Male Smoker Insurance Cost Boxplot')\nax[1,2].set_xlabel('Insurance Cost (USD)')\n\nplt.tight_layout(pad = 4)\n\nplt.show()\nplt.clf()\n\n\n\n\n\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the reason why the cost distribution had two clusters was due to the difference in BMI in each male smoker.

Right-skewed distribution is again present. - Knowing this, we should go with the median as the most appropriate statistic instead of the mean.\nGraph Two: Barplot of Average Cost per Child - Similar to the male nonsmokers, there seems to be a trend that having more children will result in higher average insurance costs. - Given the information from the smokers, when an individual has 5 children or more, their insurance costs drops on average. - However, the lowest average comes from having no children at all.\nGraph Three: Scatterplot of Cost vs BMI with Region - Again, there is no correlation between cost and BMI of nonsmokers. - No trends with the region.\nGraph Four: Scatterplot of Cost vs Age with Children - Strong linear relationship between insurance cost and age. - A secondary trend is shown with the number of children. - The less children, the insurance cost is on the lower end of the linear relationship. - The more children, the insurance cost is on the higher end of the linear relationship - The outliers do not follow the trend line.\nGraph Five: Barplot of Average Cost per Region - There is a slight trend of region importance. - The northeast is more expensive on average than the southwest.\nGraph Six: Boxplot of Male Smoker Insurance Cost -

    "text": "Summary:\nThe interactive visualization has 4 parts to it. The salary, tuition, debt estimators, and debt calculator. The first one explores the majors their potential salaries. A prospective student may want to see their choices and what their salary could line up during their career. Next, the tuition estimator explores a generalized tuition cost for the students exploring their major in their state of choice. Thirdly, the debt estimator looks into your potential 4-year degree debt based on your family’s income. It is an average of all the students for each university, but it still is a good indicator of how much debt a student will accumulate for their 4 years. Lastly, the final tool looks at how long a student will be in debt according to their major category of choice. In this visual, you can also see how long their projected student debts will last. In essense, this tool is another great tool to help out students in high school who are interested in going into higher education."
