  summary: "I've completed various projects applying advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to solve practical problems. Notably, I leveraged MANOVA and classification methods to uncover significant predictors of wine type and quality, analyzed U.S. healthcare spending trends from 1980-2014 to identify factors behind rising costs, and developed a Random Forest model achieving high accuracy to classify patient symptom severity. Additionally, I've created interactive dashboards—including a Quarto dashboard visualizing 100m sprint results and Shiny apps analyzing UK accident data and Yelp spatial reviews—and delivered machine learning models with measurable outcomes, such as a 56% performance increase in forecasting customer returns and accurate classification of wine origins and income brackets exceeding $50K."
