        "\n",
        "This paper presents a machine learning study that aims to predict severity levels in patients by utilizing a random forest approach based on symptom analysis. The objective of the study was to develop accurate rules for classifying patients into three severity levels: Mild, Moderate, and Severe. The dataset consisted of patient symptoms, which were used in conjunction with a random forest model for the classification task. The results indicated that patients with 1 to 3 symptoms, including depression, were classified as Mild, while those with at least 3 symptoms, including depression and cramps, were classified as Moderate. Patients with 4 symptoms, including cramps and spasms, were classified as Severe. The study conducted comprehensive evaluations using metrics such as the confusion matrix, ROC AUC, precision vs recall, and kappa to assess the performance of the random forest model. The results highlighted the promising performance of the model in accurately predicting severity levels among patients. The findings from this study provide robust evidence that can contribute to personalized healthcare and effective treatment planning.\n",

        "In the field of rare diseases, physicians often observe variations in the severity levels of patients; however, there is a lack of established guidelines to map individual patients directly to specific severity levels. Our client, who is developing a product for this rare disease, aims to target patients with moderate to severe conditions. To address this challenge, the client possesses a comprehensive database containing clinically relevant information about the disease, including symptom flags and a symptom count variable. Additionally, each patient in the database has been rated by a physician as mild, moderate, or severe. The client has approached [REDACTED] with the objective of extracting the mental heuristics employed by physicians when assigning severity labels to patients. The task at hand involves deriving simple rules (1-3 per severity level) from the database that can effectively classify patients. For instance, a set of rules might involve identifying patients as severe if they exhibit fatigue or have exactly two symptoms. By extracting these rules, our aim is to provide the client with a clearer understanding of the factors influencing severity levels in order to enhance their product development and enable more personalized patient care.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Drop the ID column: The code removes a column named \"Patient\" from the dataset. This column likely contains unique identifiers for each patient, and since it's not relevant for our analysis, we can safely remove it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create dummy columns for \"Number of Symptoms\": The code converts a column called \"Number of Symptoms\" into multiple binary columns, known as dummy variables. Each dummy variable represents a unique value in the original column. This transformation helps us to use categorical data in our machine learning model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Concatenate the dummy columns with the original dataframe: The code combines the newly created dummy columns with the original dataset. This ensures that we retain all the existing information while incorporating the transformed categorical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Drop the original \"Number of Symptoms\" column: Since we have created the dummy columns, we no longer need the original \"Number of Symptoms\" column. Therefore, the code removes this column from the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y): The code splits the dataset into two parts. The features, represented by the variable X, contain all the columns except the \"Final Category\" column, which is the target variable we want to predict. The target variable, represented by the variable y, contains only the \"Final Category\" column. This is the severity cases of 'Mild', 'Moderate' and 'Severe'\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Perform feature selection using Random Forest: The code utilizes a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest to identify the most important features for each category in the target variable. It trains a separate Random Forest model for each category and determines the top three features that contribute the most to predicting that category.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Store the top features for each category: The code stores the top three features for each category in a dictionary called \"top_features.\" Each category is represented by a label, and the corresponding top features are stored as a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Print the top 3 features for each label: The code then prints the top three features for each category in the target variable. This information helps us understand which features are most influential in determining the predicted category.\n",

        "Overall, this code prepares the data by transforming categorical data into a suitable format and identifies the top features that contribute to predicting different categories.

        "\n",
        "1. Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y) using only the top features: The code selects specific features from the dataset based on their importance in predicting the target variable. These features are obtained from the \"top_features\" dictionary, which contains the top three features for each category (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) in the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Encode the target variable using label encoding: The target variable \"Final Category\" is a categorical variable. To use it in the machine learning model, we need to convert it into numeric form. The code uses label encoding, which assigns a unique numeric value to each category in the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Create a random forest model using the top features: The code initializes a Random Forest model with a specific random state. Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Perform 10-fold cross-validation: The code evaluates the performance of the Random Forest model using a technique called cross-validation. Cross-validation helps estimate how well the model will generalize to new, unseen data. In this case, 10-fold cross-validation is performed, which means the dataset is divided into 10 equal parts (folds). The model is trained and tested 10 times, with each fold serving as the test set once.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Print the cross-validation scores: The code prints the cross-validation scores obtained from each fold. These scores indicate how well the model performed on each fold. Additionally, the mean cross-validation score is calculated, which provides an overall measure of the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "7. Make predictions on the training set: The code uses the trained model to make predictions on the same dataset that was used for training. This helps evaluate how well the model can predict the target variable for the given features.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Print the confusion matrix: The code prints a confusion matrix, which is a table that shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model. It provides insights into the model's performance for each category in the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Calculate and print other evaluation metrics: The code calculates additional evaluation metrics such as ROC AUC score, recall, precision, and Kappa metric. These metrics help assess the model's performance in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and agreement beyond chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this code builds a Random Forest model using selected features, evaluates its performance through cross-validation, and provides insights into the model's predictive capabilities using various evaluation metrics. The goal is to understand how well the model can predict the categories in the target variable based on the selected features."

        "# Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This study focused on predicting severity levels in patients with a rare disease using a random forest approach based on symptom analysis. The client's goal was to map individual patients to appropriate severity levels, given the absence of established guidelines. By leveraging a comprehensive database containing clinically relevant information and severity ratings provided by physicians, we extracted simple rules to classify patients.\n",
        "\n",
        "The study revealed that patients with 1 to 3 symptoms, including depression, were classified as 'Mild'. For patients with at least 3 symptoms, the presence of depression and cramps (at least 2 symptoms) indicated a classification of 'Moderate'. Lastly, patients presenting with 4 symptoms, including cramps and spasms (at least 2 symptoms), were categorized as 'Severe'.\n",
        "\n",
        "The derived rules provide valuable insights into the mental heuristics employed by physicians when assessing severity levels in patients. By incorporating these rules into the client's product development, personalized healthcare targeting patients with moderate to severe disease can be enhanced. Furthermore, these findings contribute to filling the existing gap in severity level guidelines for this rare disease.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Further Research\n",
        "\n",
        "It is recommended to validate and refine these rules using larger datasets. By expanding the dataset, researchers can ensure the generalizability of the derived rules and improve the accuracy of the classification. Additionally, exploring additional factors that may influence severity levels, such as demographic information, medical history, or genetic markers, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease and enhance the prediction models.\n",
        "\n",
        "By continuing to refine and validate the rules and incorporating more factors into the analysis, personalized treatment for patients with this rare disease can be further optimized, leading to improved patient outcomes. The combination of symptom analysis and machine learning approaches holds significant potential for facilitating accurate classification and personalized healthcare in various medical domains.\n",
