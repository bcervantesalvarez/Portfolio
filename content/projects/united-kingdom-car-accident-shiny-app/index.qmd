  summary: "I developed an interactive Shiny dashboard to analyze time-series data on UK accidents, enabling users to visualize and explore trends, seasonality, and accident severity over custom date ranges. I included the ability to perform advanced statistical analyses including detrending, autocorrelation assessment, and day-of-week frequency evaluations in the shiny application; clearly demonstrating insights such as higher accident occurrences on weekends. Key visual metrics included daily fatality counts and detrended accident trends, enhancing data interpretability and enabling targeted decision-making."
