description: "Teaching R, but better! The package webR by George Stagg transforms traditional lectures into dynamic and interactive sessions. It helps maintain student interest and improves comprehension through hands-on practice. Plus, it simplifies the teaching process, allowing instructors to focus on content delivery rather than technical setup."

  summary: "I introduced Quarto, highlighting its capabilities for creating dynamic presentations, interactive Shiny applications, and professional portfolio websites using multiple languages like R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS. I demonstrated practical uses, including generating simulated datasets, implementing cross-language coding examples with tabsets, and deploying interactive visualizations and Shiny apps directly within Quarto. Additionally, I emphasized mastering GitHub, RMarkdown, and Shiny as foundational skills before fully leveraging Quartoâ€™s extensive features."
