description: "This study examines key factors influencing loan approval using logistic regression and ANOVA on 32,581 simulated applications. Significant predictors include income, home ownership, and loan amount, with higher income increasing approval odds. Unexpected findings, like lower odds for higher credit scores, suggest potential model refinement. ANOVA further explores differences in interest rates and loan-to-income ratios across categories, offering practical insights for both lenders and applicants."
