<!-- Policy Container #1: Intro & Purpose -->
<section class="policy-block policy-section">
  <h2>My Website Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I want to be fully transparent about 
    how I collect, store, and use information to keep improving the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of this policy is to inform you about the nature of the data gathered, 
    whether you choose to provide it directly (e.g., via contact forms) or it’s 
    collected automatically (e.g., analytics). By clarifying these points, I 
    hope you can navigate and enjoy the site with peace of mind.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Policy Container #2: Transparency -->
<section class="policy-block policy-section">
  <h2>Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    Your privacy matters to me. This policy outlines how my portfolio gathers data—both
    automatically (e.g., usage metrics) and voluntarily (e.g., you submitting a form).
    It also covers how that information is used to enhance your experience.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <strong>Scope:</strong> This policy applies solely to this website and doesn’t extend 
    to external platforms or services you might access through hyperlinks. Once you leave 
    this site, any interaction is bound by that external platform’s privacy rules.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Policy Container #3: What Data is Collected? -->
<section class="policy-block policy-section">
  <h2>What Data Is Collected?</h2>
  <p>
    My data collection can be categorized into two types: anonymous usage data and optional 
    personal data you choose to provide.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Pages Visited:</strong> The specific pages you explore, helping me see 
      which sections are popular or may need improvement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Time Spent:</strong> Average duration on each page to gauge how engaging 
      or valuable the content is.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Browser &amp; Device Info:</strong> Basic data about your device type, 
      operating system, and browser—this helps me optimize layout and performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Voluntary Information:</strong> Anything you might type into forms, such as 
      your name, email, or message content, if you contact me directly.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Google Analytics is used to collect anonymous metrics. No personally identifiable 
    information (PII) is automatically gathered by my analytics unless you voluntarily 
    provide it (e.g., via contact forms).
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Policy Container #4: How Is This Data Used? -->
<section class="policy-block policy-section">
  <h2>How Is This Data Used?</h2>
  <p>
    I use anonymous usage data to understand which areas of the site resonate with
    visitors. For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Enhancing navigation so frequently visited sections are easier to access 
      and explore
    </li>
    <li>
      Creating or refining content in areas where users show high engagement 
      or interest
    </li>
    <li>
      Diagnosing performance bottlenecks or design issues on specific pages
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your data is never sold or passed to third parties beyond the analytics 
    processors that supply aggregated metrics. Where personal data is shared 
    voluntarily, such as in a contact form, it’s strictly used to respond 
    to your inquiries or feedback.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Policy Container #5: Cookie Usage -->
<section class="policy-block policy-section">
  <h2>Cookie Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Cookies are small data files stored on your device that enable better 
    functionality and anonymous statistical analysis. By default, this site 
    primarily employs cookies for analytics. If you choose to block cookies 
    within your browser, the core features of the site will remain accessible, 
    but certain analytics or performance enhancements may not function as intended.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any cookies used here do not collect PII but rather facilitate session 
    continuity and usage metrics. You remain in control: you can delete 
    existing cookies or prevent new ones from being set at any time.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Policy Container #6: Your Choices -->
<section class="policy-block policy-section">
  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You have several ways to manage your data and privacy preferences:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cookie Consent Banner:</strong> If provided, allows you to opt in 
      or out of certain tracking.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Browser Extensions:</strong> 
      <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Google Analytics Opt-out
      </a> 
      or similar tools can block analytics tracking.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Browser Settings:</strong> Adjust your settings to disable cookies 
      altogether.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Personal Data Requests:</strong> If you submit personal info (like 
      through a contact form), you can request its deletion or modification at 
      any time by contacting me directly.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I encourage you to choose whichever methods align best with your comfort 
    level regarding data collection and personalization.
