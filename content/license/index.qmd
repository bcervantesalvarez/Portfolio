    I may occasionally showcase code snippets as examples, tutorials, or

  <h2>Use of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
  <p>
    Some content on this site—including text, illustrative examples, or
    ideation—benefited from AI-based assistance (most notably OpenAI’s
    language models). This AI support helped accelerate brainstorming,
    generation of first drafts, and code scaffolding.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, every final edit, conceptual choice, and validation step is
    exclusively my responsibility. If you notice any inaccuracies or suspect AI
    artifacts, please let me know. I am committed to refining and correcting
    content whenever issues arise.

  <p>
    In the spirit of responsible AI, I aim to avoid sharing harmful,
    confidential, or personally identifiable information. Should any
    content inadvertently breach ethical or privacy guidelines, I will
    address it promptly upon being made aware.
